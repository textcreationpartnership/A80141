         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface,</head>
            <p>To the Churches of Chriſt, and to all that call on the name of the Lord in truth and ſincerity, in all places, grace and peace be multiplyed through the knowledge of God our father, and our Lord Jeſus, in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his Grace.</p>
            <p>HOly brethren, partakers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly calling, whoſe hearts are <hi>Sion</hi>-ward, how much doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us in this our day, to be much inquiring into and after the things that belong to our Peace, and the peace of <hi>Sion? e. i.</hi> of all the Churches of Chriſt: my brethren to whom theſe may come, I intend not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you long in this Preface, but to minde you with ſome neceſſary things relating to the enſuing diſcourſe, that you may read it with the more profit and advantage to your ſouls.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170388:3"/>
            <p> I can ſay it was of weight upon my heart, and now at laſt it is burſt out, I have been for ſometime of late prevented, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been fighting and contending with beaſts after the manner of men <hi>(e. i.</hi> men of beaſtly principles and ſpirits) not at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but in <hi>England,</hi> but now I do perceive their reſolutions are to continue ſo, and grow worſe and worſe, deceiving, being deceived, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turned from them according to the word of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. as from dogs that trample all under feet, and turn again and rent and tear: and have been redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving time in winters cold, for the bringing forth this ſmall Treatiſe, and probably it may, and likely it muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with ſome judgings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions from men, it may be from ſome Saints at firſt ſight, before conſideration: but I truſt that the heavenly hand hath been ſo made manifeſt in aſsiſting and guiding the heart and hand in this work, that it will paſs the ſcorns, cenſures and contradictions of this world, without juſt cauſe of fear or ſhame. My friends, I can truly ſay, I have
<pb facs="tcp:170388:3"/> aimed chiefly at the good of Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers not onely in, but out of the Churches likewiſe, for I doubt not but that there are many that are precious that are not yet come to walk in the way of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>e. i.</hi> in the order and ordinances thereof. I deſire the Reader to read with patience and ſuſpend judging (that ſo he may be kept from ſinning in ſtead of profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) until he is paſſed through the work.</p>
            <p>I have here preſented you, (having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at preſent that I could think better) with the Covenants Firſt and Second, with their diſtinctions and adminiſtrations, the taking away of the firſt, and eſtabliſhing of the ſecond, with the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt in the New Covenant, and many Principles of the faith, and the Duties of the New Covenant particularly ſtated, with the Promiſes and Priviledges, in which is wrapt up the ſum of the Goſpel and marrow of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>My method in the ſtating and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenants is, firſt, to prove the diſtinction and that they are two, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtating them, and wherein they differ,
<pb facs="tcp:170388:4"/> and after, by it ſelf, I have endeavoured to anſwer ſuch Queries and objections as are or may be made againſt the truth herein preſented. Therefore my deſire is, that the Reader would ſuſpend judging till he come to the end, and probably he may finde his objections anſwered, and his ſcruples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: and as I can ſay, that for Saints, for <hi>Sions</hi> ſake I have written it, ſo my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and prayer is, that it may come to you in the bleſsing of the Lord, that you would read and deſire the Lord to help you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that you would take heed of your own wiſdom, and ſubmit your ſelves to the wiſdom that is from above, ſee <hi>James</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. I do judge the things contained in this diſcourſe to be ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and uſeful for all Saints, of all ſtates and ciſes, and of all Nations, that it would be a meet companion at all times. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire information in the Covenant of Gods grace in Chriſt (the true life of Saints) ſomething you may finde of this nature here, and likewiſe of Chriſt the Mediator of the New Covenant, or if you would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your ſelves with the Principles of
<pb facs="tcp:170388:4"/> the faith, and the Duties, and the great and precious Promiſes, and Priviledges of the New Covenant, ſomething of light and direction may you find herein, although much weakneſs and imperfection, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the writer, in this great myſtery, for we know but in part, and he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that he ſees ſo much of wonder in this diſpenſation of grace in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that he rather admires then expects to bring it forth in its own glory, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done though brief, though ſhort of the matter in every particular, yet he hath made an Eſſay, an entrance. If God pleaſe to help any of his ſervants to make a further progreſs herein, I ſhall rejoyce, or help his people to imbrace and profit by this mite, I have my deſire, and this is the prayer of him who is, the Lord and his peoples in the ſervice of the New Covenant.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Of the excellencie of Jeſus; a truth of very great concernment, and as it is the duty, ſo it ſhould be the care of every Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſter and Chriſtian, to keep up the dignity and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170388:6"/> excellency of Jeſus Chriſt in his perſon, work, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; I mean the true Meſſiah, Jeſus that was born of <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin according to promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 31. and 2. 7. Iſay, 7. 14. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, &amp;c.</hi> Who was, and is truly the the Son of God and the Son of man, <hi>Of the ſeed of</hi> David <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 1. 3, 4. Acts 2. 30. <hi>made of a Woman, and declared to be the Son of God, with power by his reſurrection from the dead.</hi> I ſay, it concerns us to know and have faith in this Jeſus, thus <hi>Promiſed,</hi> and <hi>Born,</hi> and <hi>Crucified,</hi> and <hi>Raiſed,</hi> and <hi>Aſcended into Heaven, who is at the right hand of God, Angels, and Principalities and Powers being made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him.</hi> A principle of truth it is, being truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and lived in, will preſerve ſouls in life and truth, and root out and vanquiſh the new Notions and imaginary fancies about Chriſt, making Heaven, and Chriſt, and the right hand of God, and all to be within them, a bottomleſs fancy, an imaginary Chriſt and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But to our work, which is to exalt the true Chriſt, whom God hath exalted, and to honour him whom God the Father hath honoured, <hi>John</hi> 5. 22, 23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. In this Epiſtle our Apoſtle, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, exalts Chriſt, or rather diſcovers his exaltation by the father:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Above Angels, <hi>chap.</hi> 1, 4. not onely above bad Angels but alſo good Angels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Above <hi>Moſes,</hi> chap. 3. 5, 6. <hi>Moſes a ſervant, Chriſt a Son over his own houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Above the Prieſts, or Prieſthood under the Law, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. and 7. and ſo conſequently above the old Teſtament-Miniſtry, and Miniſtration, <hi>viz.</hi> in Authority, Dignity, and Excellency.</p>
               <p>Hence he came to take away or put an end to that Miniſtry, or Prieſthood, and Covenant, which is the ſecond ſpecial work of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170388:6"/> ſhould be of all good men, to exalt the New Covenant above the Old, which is the truth declared in the Scripture read unto you, <hi>viz. He taketh away the firſt, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond,</hi> viz. The firſt or old Covenant or Teſtament, that he might eſtabliſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>Now that it is the two Covenants that is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is clear; for the word <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> are <hi>Relatives:</hi> The word <hi>He,</hi> relates to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> chap. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 24. and 28. <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> relates to the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Covenants,</hi> chap. 8. 6, 7, 8. called alſo the old and the new Covenants, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>So that the true ſenſe and meaning of the words, is this; That God ſent Jeſus Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt came to take away the <hi>firſt,</hi> the old Covenant, that he might eſtabliſh the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the new Covenant, which we uſually call the Covenant of grace, becauſe its the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of grace, and all is grace from firſt to laſt in it. So that the words afford us two leſſons.</p>

               <p>To ſtate the covenants as they are diſtinct both the old and new.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Confirming the firſt or old covenant, the quaere may be; What we are to underſtand to be the firſt or old covenant?</p>
               <p>In this I underſtand the Scripture to be clear, that by the old covenant we underſtand, <hi>the covenant that God made with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>when be brought them out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> Jer. 31. 31, 32. Where God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to <hi>make a new covenant, not ſuch a covenant as he made with their Fathers, when he took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. So that the old covenant is that which God made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was the covenant from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> the Moral cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and judicial Law. The Moral Law being laid as the foundation of the whole, for indeed that was the covenant in ſum and ſubſtance; the other was grounded on it, the firſt table relating to God on which the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial was built and was included, the ſecond to man, on both which the judicial or political part of the Law was bottomed, and ſo the whole indeed was moral in that miniſtration or Covenant. And the moral Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the ten commands or precepts, are called the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, anſwerable to <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 2.—So that by the firſt covenant we are to underſtand the covenant or Law made with the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Mount Sinai, Exod.</hi> 19. and 20. chapters. And this the Apoſtle clears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18. <hi>We are not come to the mount that might not be touched, and that burned with fire;</hi> which clearly alludes to mount Sinai, the fiery giving of the law, and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24, 25. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us expreſly that the old covenant, of which <hi>Hagar</hi> the bondwoman was a type, <hi>was from Mount Sinai:</hi> now what covenant was it that was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> when God brought them out of the Land of Egypt? It was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170388:8"/> the Law: and what covenant was it that was given from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> but the Law which we call Moral, and in it, and with it the ceremonial and judicial? Further, the old covenant was made in ſubſtance with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10, 11. Circumciſion was the ſum of the old covenant, and Abridgement of it, diſtinct from the covenant of grace that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as I ſhall prove in its time and place.</p>
               <p>But firſt to prove it to be the ſubſtance of the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is the work in hand, I ſhall preſent clear and convincing grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its called in Scripture, A covenant frequently, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. and 13. Its called a covenant three times, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou ſhilt keep my covenant therefore,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>This is my covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee. Every man child among you ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>My covenant ſhall be in your fleſh for an everlaſting covenant,</hi> Acts 7. 8. <hi>And he gave them the covenant of circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Circumciſion is called a token of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, therefore not the covenant it ſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>It ſhall be a token of the covenant between me and you,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. <hi>Abraham</hi> received it <hi>a ſign and a ſeal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true its called <hi>a token, a ſign and ſeal,</hi> yet that proves not but that it is a covenant, as wel as a ſign and ſeal, for I do underſtand that its called a covenant as it was the ſum and ſubſtance of the old covenant, which was inlarged on <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> And it was a ſign or token (and ſeal too) to <hi>Abraham</hi> (but to none elſe as to <hi>Abraham) viz.</hi> a token of the covenant of grace God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> before. This is plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Abraham</hi> received <hi>the ſign of ciriumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith he had before he was circumciſed, that he might be the father of all them that believe.</hi> Note this, It was given a ſign and ſeal of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might be the father of all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170388:8"/> that believe: So that it was a ſign and ſeal of his faith in the Goſpel covenant, and the whole old covenant in its largeſt extent was a ſign or token of the Goſpel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as I ſhall more fully clear in its place; ſo that it is a covenant, and a ſign and a ſeal of another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> the covenant of grace God made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove circumciſion to be the ſum of the old covenant, it was eſtabliſhed upon the Old Teſtament promiſe: the promiſe of the old covenant was annexed to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The New Teſtament is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes: The ſum of the Old Teſtament covenant (on Gods part) was, that he would be their God, and give them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> on this condition that they keep the other part of the covenant on their part, <hi>viz.</hi> To be circumciſed; this is plain, was the old covenant both on Gods part and on theirs, and circumciſion was a covenant eſtabliſhed on the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was an uſher to the covenant from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> was to Chriſt is plain, in that it binds to the doing of the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. <hi>Behold, I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, that if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit ye nothing at all,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>For I teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to every one that is circumciſed, that he is a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the whole Law.</hi> And doubtleſs, for this cauſe the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>a yoke which neither they, nor their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to bear,</hi>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ts 15. 10. Not the act of circumciſion, that would be weak to ſuppoſe that to be ſuch a yoke, but the bondage of it, as it was the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Circumciſion ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="4">4. Becauſe circumciſion and the law ſtands and falls together: keep up circumciſion and keep up the Law, the yoke, the bondage, what not? all that was in the law. Therefore circumciſion is not the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170388:9"/> but the old, even a ſign of the new, and muſt fall when the ſubſtance was come, of which it was a ſign.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It muſt be the ſame in ſubſtance as that from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> elſe God kept not his covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, viz.</hi> The promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> on his and his poſterities being circumciſed, and after, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate ſuch multitudes of laws and ſtatutes which were by his poſterity to be performed, without which they might not inherit the Land. Nay, God caſt them out of it for tranſgreſſion of thoſe Laws which had been contrary to the covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend in behalf of his poſterity (where he required nothing but circumciſion, and on that promiſed the Land of <hi>Canaan)</hi> had not the whole law been invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and included in circumciſion: So that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from <hi>Mount Sanai</hi> was the drawing out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of circumciſion at length, and branching it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into its parts; but not an adding to it, for that could not be without wrong to the covenant God made to, and with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as hath been minded, which would be blaſphemy againſt God ſo to think.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true that God made not the covenant from <hi>Sinai</hi> with the fathers in its length &amp; bredth, as it was made from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> there were many things added that was not expreſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170388:9"/> you from hence the great miſtake of thoſe who claim Church-memberſhip for Infants, from their Church-memberſhip in the old covenant, ſuppoſing it to be the ſame as now, ſeeing no repeal. Note this, Infants were never Church-members by virtue of the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but by this of circumciſion which was the old, and done away when the new was come in force as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. but of this by the way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 I come to ſtate the new or ſecond covenant called in Scripture a new covenant, a ſecond covenant, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. and 61. 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. and 37. 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20. A covenant of peace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 26. a Holy covenant, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 72.</p>
               <p>This covenant we ſhall conſider, 1. as it lay in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſo it was from the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. the Lord ſpeaking of the enmity that he would put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the Serpent, ſaid; <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> In theſe few words is held forth the ſuffering of Chriſt and his conqueſt over the ſerpent and his ſeed, the ſubſtance of the covenant of grace.

And this is the covenant the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>God made with</hi> Abraham <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 17. <hi>which the Law could not diſanul:</hi> where you may note by the way that this covenant is mentioned by the Apoſtle as diſtinct from the law, that was another covenant, yet ſuch a one as could not diſanual this. Again, this covenant we have in promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. 32, 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>chap.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In ſum, This is the Covenant of Grace, that God now owns his people in; a Covenant of Grace and Peace in Jeſus, the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> writing the Law of faith, love, and the fear of his name in their ſouls, by his ſinger, the holy ſpirit, intereſting them in grace here, and aſſurance of glory hereafter, by vertue of which they are made willing faithfully to live to him here, and patiently to wait for the glory that ſhall be revealed. And in this covenant are none of God own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the true ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt and ſuch as are in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>If you are Chriſts then are you Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this covenant as its written in the hearts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, without which in the Goſpel account they are none of his, ſo is it written in the ſcriptures of truth, by the ſame ſpirit, and the ſpirit in believers works them and guides them to the truth of God in ſcripture (for by this means, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſcripture, it is all firſt received, and afterwards by degrees increaſed) ſo that its none of the ſpirit of Chriſt that leads a way from and beſides the law of Chriſt in Scripture, ſo that the law written in the heart, guides to the law of Chriſt in ſcripture, and makes ſouls willing to walk according thereunto. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 8. 20.</p>
               <p>This is the covenant that gives grace and peace, faith and love, ſtrength and perſeverance, even bleſſedneſs comes in with this covenant, both as to grace and glory. This is the everlaſting <hi>Covenant,</hi> that is by <hi>blood,</hi> by vertue of which poor <hi>Priſoners are delivered out of the pit, wherein was no water.</hi> Zach. 9. 11.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular I minded was, Why they are called firſt and ſecond, old and new covenants.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the old covenant, as it relates to matter of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170388:10"/> work in the miniſtration of it was firſt, we leave things as in the eternal counſel of God, there being no firſt or laſt there, (in reſpect of time) but as its brought forth to us, ſo its <hi>firſt and ſecond, firſt and laſt, old and new,</hi> now the firſt or old covenant was firſt promulgated after the creation to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice before his fall, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt die;</hi> Here was the firſt covenant, wherein was no diſcovery of Chriſt and grace, but do and live, tranſgreſs and die. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the old covenant in Scripture is taken from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> yet here is the beginning of the work. And it was there <hi>added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, that ſin might appear out of meaſure ſinfull,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. Rom. 7. 13. chap. 5. 20. <hi>The law entred that the offence might abound, &amp;c.</hi> viz. The offence that came in by the breach of that covenant in Paradice. See <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Yet, ſecondly, as it was given from <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> as a miniſtration, ſo it was firſt, or the old covenant: the other lay full in promiſes, and virtually was in being, yet not given forth as a miniſtration, nor could it be <hi>till the death of the teſtator;</hi> ſo that on this account that from <hi>Sinai</hi> was the old and firſt; and this from <hi>Mount Sion, (the perfection of beauty)</hi> the new and ſecond, even the new covenant of everlaſting love, peace, and life, as the old and natural man was firſt, ſo the old covenant ſutable to that eſtate was firſt, and as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man is ſecond, ſo is the ſpiritual covenant ſecond: <hi>ſo then that was not firſt which was ſpiritual, but that which was natural, and afterward that which was ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 46. So that the firſt covenant had relation to the old eſtate of man, and gathered in the natural ſeed, the ſecond to the new eſtate of man, in Chriſt, and gathers in onely the ſpiritual ſeed. Here is a myſtery too high for the carnal heart, the old and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, bleſſed are thoſe that are truly intereſted in this grace. <hi>Oh the heighth and depth of the unſearchable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. In the matter, as hath been minded already, and this difference lieth either (firſt) in the matter as it was firſt given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, wich was one and the ſame in nature, with that from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> as hath been already minded, though differing in terms, being both conditional. <hi>viz.</hi> life promiſed on terms of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:170388:11"/>
                  <p> Or ſecondly, as it was renewed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
                  <p>Or Thirdly, as it was given forth more at large from <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> to the body of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And more eſpecially in the matter of the old Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as it was conditional in the firſt, ſecond, and third place. It was conditional, a Covenant of works with Promiſes to it, on condition of being performed. But the Covenant of the Goſpel was abſolute without condition, on Gods part, ſo that notwithſtanding the terms or words might be the ſame, yet it being abſolute and without condition, it differs in the very matter: as for Inſtance, ſuppoſe a man condition with a ſervant, and promiſe him reward for his ſervice, and require the ſervice he conditioned for, but gives nothing to enable him to the performance of it, not having promiſed, but every way enables his ſon for ſervice, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of him. This quite changes the matter of the Covenant: the firſt ſaith, <hi>do this and live:</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond gives life firſt and then ſaith, <hi>do. John</hi> 11. 26. <hi>He that liveth, and believeth ſhall never die.</hi> The firſt ſaith, <hi>Make you a new heart and a new ſpirit for why will ye die, Oh houſe of Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. The ſecond ſaith, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and I will give you a heart of fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit in you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. This is the diſtinct language of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from the old, <hi>I will write my law in their heart, and I will put my fear in them, that they ſhall not depart away from me. And in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word that was a Covenant that might be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that was broken. This is a Covenant that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor ſhall not be broken, This is the firſt difference in the matter of them. The firſt commands to do, but gives no power. The ſecond gives power in and with the command, <hi>John</hi> 5. 25. The dead ſhall hear the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170388:12"/> voice of the Son of God, and live, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that the firſt is called <hi>a voice of words,</hi> Heb. 12. 19. The ſecond is, <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 5. 16.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond difference between the two covenants was in the manner of adminiſtring, and this difference lieth eſpecially in theſe two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In the manner of the giving.</item>
                     <item>2. In the manner of the execution.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The firſt was given not onely, as hath been minded, with condition, but alſo with a great deal of fear and dread, <hi>Sounding of Trumpets, burning of fire, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Darkneſs, and Tempeſt,</hi> which made the people to tremble, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 16. So dreadful was the giving of this covenant, that <hi>Moſes</hi> the mediator thereof, ſaid at the ſight of it, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> Heb. 12. 21. thereby to preſent its nature, a dreadful covenant; hence its called <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 2. <hi>a fierie Law, or a law of fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the new covenant from <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> was, and is adminiſtred in all ſweetneſs and love. It preacheth forth grace and peace, there is never a word of dread and darkneſs in it, but to thoſe that reject it.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is ſo ordinarily called the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> That is, <hi>Glad tidings, or good tidings of good things.</hi> Tidings of <hi>Peace and Rcconciliation,</hi> tidings of <hi>Pardon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins;</hi> in a word tidings of <hi>Grace and Glory,</hi> this is the manner of the miniſtry of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In the manner of execution, and that in its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1. the Law, as hath been minded, commanded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience while it continued but gave no power to obey; but this in its miniſtration begets life, love, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, it accompliſheth <hi>the birth from above;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets <hi>to a lively hope,</hi> &amp;c. for it is <hi>the miniſtration of the</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170388:12"/> 
                     <hi>Spirit.</hi> There is never a ſoul actually in this covenant, but by the virtue of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that perſons come not viſibly into it by natural generation as into the old, but by regeneration, and the work of the holy ſpirit. Believe it friends, this is a great Goſpel truth, that whoſoever cannot ſet ſeal unto it, will one day know that they are ſtrangers to it, notwithſtanding the great cheats, and deceits that are in the world about this matter: Some carrying on the covenant in way of generation, and others ſuppoſe they come to it of their own will; both will find it firſt or laſt, that they are no further then the firſt covenant, that of Nature, and ſhort of that of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That executed the curſe, wrath, and vengeance, on the Tranſgreſſors of it; but this mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, healing of back-ſlidings: the voice of the firſt was, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> But the voice of the ſecond, is, if they ſin, <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and remember their ſins no more. If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and if we confeſs our ſins he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> &amp;c. This is a covenant in which juſtice and faithfulneſs is ingaged to forgive the ſins of thoſe that are in it. In a word, that covenant in its adminiſtration brought firſt to duty, and from thence ſome few, even a remnant, were brought to Chriſt. This brings firſt to Chriſt and Grace, and then to duty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They differ in the righteouſneſs. The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that covenant was a righteouſneſs of works to be done by them; <hi>If you obſerve and do theſe things this ſhall be your righteouſneſs,</hi> Deut. 6. 25. No longer work, no longer righteous: the righteouſneſs of the law ſpeaketh on this wiſe, <hi>The man that doth them, ſhall even live in them,</hi> Rom. 10. 5.</p>
                  <p>But the righteouſneſs of this covenant is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170388:13"/> of faith, even the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which comes on all that believe, this is the name by which he ſhall be called: The Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. <hi>and in him ſhall all the ſeed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be juſtified, and ſhall glory,</hi> Iſa. 45. 25. For <hi>by him (viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. Note, believers in this covenant are juſtified from that <hi>which the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>could not juſtifie from.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is that? from ſin: the law could not juſtifie from ſin: That could curſe and condemn for ſin, but could not juſtifie from ſin: but this covenant juſtifieth from ſin, <hi>becauſe the blood of this covenant taketh away ſin,</hi> and that out of the conſcience as well as out of the converſation; ſo that (in a word) as the righteouſneſs of that covenant was a righteouſneſs of works, and ſo was their own righteouſneſs; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the law.</hi> But the righteouſneſs of this covenant is the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, apprehended, applied by faith, <hi>even the righteouſneſs, that is of God by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A bleſſed word to believers, they ſtand to God, not in their own righteouſneſs, but in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt wrought for them, revealed to and in them, and applied.</p>
                  <p>The fourth difference between the two covenants, is, in the ſeed with whom the covenants were made, and here lyeth a truth of very great concernment to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the diſtinct ſeeds of the covenants. The ſeed with whom the old covenant was made, were the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> Such as came of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the fleſhly ſeed were the ſubjects of that covenant. Take it firſt as made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in circumciſion, or after as it was inlarged from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> it was given to the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170388:13"/> to the fleſhly ſeed, and ſo it continued till Chriſt came, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. But this new covenant is made with Chriſt and all the ſpiritual ſeed in him. The new covenant knows no fleſhly ſeed, though old covenant ſpirited men are loath to know any other ſeed now then the fleſhly ſeed, yet account themſelves inſtructed in the new covenant, but the new covenant <hi>knowes no man after the fleſh. But if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature: old things are paſt away,</hi> &amp;c. the new covenant knows none, nor owns none to be the ſeed, but ſuch as are Chriſts. <hi>If ye are Chriſts, then are ye</hi> Arahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the Promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3. 26. Be they <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> there is no difference by nature, all alike, and by grace are the true ſeed of the covenant. <hi>The elect obtains it, and the reſt are blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> Rom. 11. 7. Oh beloved, it highly concerns every Chriſtian to come to a right diſtinction in this matter, the want whereof occaſions the generality of the ſons and daughters of men to content themſelvs in the old nature under the covenant, only the name of chriſtian ſatisfieth, or at beſt a little reformation, &amp; old covenant zeal filled with phariſaical pride and ſelf conceit of their own good eſtate, making Chriſtians by generation, being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the great new covenant work of regeneration, and the birth from above.</p>
                  <p>I leave this with you, my friends, as an undoubted truth and true diſtinction between the covenants. The one was with the fleſhly ſeed, the other with the ſpiritual, even with Chriſt, and in him with all the ſpiritual ſeed.</p>
                  <p>The fifth difference between the two covenants, is in their Mediator: that covenant had a mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. and that mediator was <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of that covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 4, 5. verſ. 4. <hi>The Lord our God made a covenant with us in</hi> Horeb, verſ. 5. <hi>I ſtood between the Lord and you at that time.</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:170388:14"/>
                  <p> But Jeſus Chriſt is the mediator of this covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>But now hath he (viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more excellent miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the mediator of a better covenant.</hi> A more excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, a better covenant.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The old and new covenants differ in their promiſes, for they both had promiſes. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the natural ſtate of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaith, <hi>They were ſtrangers to the covenants of promiſe, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. Both had promiſes, but diſtinct promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſutable to the nature of the covenants, and the people with whom they were made.</p>
                  <p>Now the difference lay mainly in two things;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>In the matter promiſed.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>In the manner of the promiſe.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. In the matter: the ſubject matter of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament promiſes conſiſted in outward things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, worldly bleſſings; ſo in circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>I will give unto thee and to thy ſeed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a ſtranger, even all the Land of</hi> Canaan. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. you may take a view of it at your leiſure, and clearly diſcern the promiſes and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of that covenant (from <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Bleſſed in the City, and in the Field, and in the fruit of the Body, and of the Cattel,</hi> &amp;c.) ſo that they were all outward bleſſings. So likewiſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>If you will be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, and the like, were the old Teſtament promiſes.</p>
                  <p>But the New Teſtament promiſes are of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not ſo much of outward bleſſings, for <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this World, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom: But they are ſpiritual and eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> John 6. 40. <hi>This is the Will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the ſon and believeth on</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170388:14"/> 
                     <hi>him, may have everlaſting life.</hi> Luke 12. 32. <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> Jam. 1. 12. <hi>The crown of life which God hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> Matth. 25. 34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom,</hi> and the like precious promiſes of the new covenant that relate to life and glory. Hence it is that Goſpel belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the manner of the promiſes. The firſt were conditional, as hath been proved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6. <hi>Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ſhall ye be a peculiar treaſure unto me, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 28. 1.</p>
                  <p>But the promiſes of the Goſpel-covenant are abſolute as hath alſo been proved. <hi>The Dead ſhall bear the voice of the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will be their God and they ſhall be my People, and they ſhall not depart away from me.</hi> &amp;c. Thus they differ very much in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; in which reſpect the new covenant is ſaid to be eſtabliſhed vpon better promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the old covenant were on condition of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but gave no power; but the new covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes <hi>make partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Peter 1. 4.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They differ in their miniſtry and prieſthood: the miniſtry and prieſthood of the old covenant was the tribe of <hi>Levie.</hi> In particular the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> were for the prieſthood, and the reſt of the tribe were the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> to do other ſervice and to miniſter before the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 50, 51. and <hi>chap.</hi> 8.—15. 19. But the Miniſter and High-prieſt of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who differs from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and prieſthood of the old covenant or Teſtament, not onely, 1 in his perſon being much more excellent, and that on ſeveral accounts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was made a Prieſt with an oath, which the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170388:15"/> 
                     <hi>Levitical</hi> prieſts were not. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 20, 21. <hi>And in as much as not without an oath he was made Prieſt, for theſe were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that ſaid unto him, The Lord ſware, and will not repent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Chriſt was made a Prieſt <hi>for ever</hi> after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck, Heb.</hi> 5. 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 21. but they of the Old Teſtament were not ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 8, 23, 24. <hi>And they truly were many Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of Death: But this man becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſt-hood,</hi> a great ground of conſolation for the Lords poor people. See <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt differs from the Old Teſtament Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in his ability to ſave. They were not able to ſave themſelves or others.</p>
                  <p>But Jeſus Chriſt, the Miniſter of the new covenant, <hi>is able to ſave all thoſe to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> A great ground for encouragement of poor ſinners to come to him and believe in him; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of conſolation to thoſe who (already) are truly come unto God by him.</p>
                  <p>A fifth difference was in the Sacrifice. They offered Bulls and Goats, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. But Jeſus Chriſt offered up himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin. Oh precious High-prieſt to give himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, &amp; that not as theſe high prieſts did offer their Sacrifices, firſt for their own ſins, and then for the ſins of others. But he that was <hi>without ſin, Holy, Harmleſs, Undefiled, there was no guile found in him,</hi> even he offered himſelf for ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. and 9. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The difference between the old and new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; is in the Tabernacle and Ordinances. 1. They were Miniſters to the Typical Tabernacle, Temple, and Altar; but Jeſus Chriſt is the Miniſter of the true Tabernacle and Temple, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1, 2. <hi>We have</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170388:15"/> 
                     <hi>ſuch an High Prieſt who is ſate down at the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens. A mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Sanctuary and true Tabernacle which God hath pitched and not men,</hi> chap. 9. 24. <hi>For Christ is not entered into the Holy Places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Note this friends, That Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>New covenant,</hi> and of the <hi>true Tabernacle, is entred into Heaven it ſelf now to appear in the preſence of God for his People.</hi> A bleſſed ground of comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to every truly gracious ſoul, to come with boldneſs to the Throne of grace, Jeſus Chriſt is there for them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond difference is in the ordinances: that covenant had ordinances alſo, and <hi>a Sanctuary,</hi> but comparatively they were but wordly &amp; carnal ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the ordinances of the new covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>The firſt covenant had alſo ordinances of Divine ſervice, and a wordly Sanctuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their ordinances made not the <hi>comers thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>were but a figure for the time being,</hi> and are called carnal <hi>ordinances impoſed on them, till the time of reformation,</hi> verſ. 10. But the Ordinances of the New Teſtament, are more ſpiritual, ſutable to the Miniſter and miniſtration, and likewiſe becauſe our Miniſter miniſters by his Spirit in and through all, which that miniſtry could not do.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They differ in their ends. The ends of the firſt covenants were, 1. <hi>To make ſin become exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> Rom. 7. 13. and <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 20. 2. <hi>To ſtop every month, and to make all guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. And ſo it became a Killing Covenant, <hi>A miniſtration of Death,</hi> and not of life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. A covenant that could not give life, for if that covenant could <hi>have given life, then verily righteouſneſs had been by it, even by the Law;</hi> Gal. 3. 21.</p>

                  <p> But Gods end in the new covenant is to give life by it. Hence its called a covenant of life and peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 10. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>It was to recover poor loſt ſinners out of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate and condition: it was to make the comers thereunto perfect, which the other could not do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.

                  <p n="10">10. And finally, the difference between the old and new covenant, is as much as is between the type, the ſhadow, and the ſubſtance: it was but a ſhadow, and repreſentation of the new covenant, a typical covenant from firſt to laſt. Hence it is that they had types and reſemblances of every thing in the Goſpel covenant, but they were but ſhadows, but reſemblances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They had a righteouſneſs commanded, which was a righteouſneſs of doing, which they could not attain, a repreſentation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt who was to fulfill all, and ſo become <hi>the end of the law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. Rom.</hi> 10. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they had an election and Son-ſhip, but it was of the <hi>natural</hi> ſeed: the new covenant is of the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> ſeed <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7. 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they had Prieſt, Sacrifice, Tabernacle and Temple, but all Typical.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They had promiſes likewiſe, but Typical as well as conditional; ſo that it is as evident as the ſun that ſhines at noon, to all whoſe eyes are open, that the differences between the covenants are clear and very great. And therefore it much concerns you not to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170388:16"/> miſtake in this matter, leaſt you live under the old in ſtead of the new, for the old will prove a covenant of death to thoſe who live and die in it. But <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit.

                  <p>Fourthly, I come now to anſwer ſuch Objections and Queries as are or may be raiſed againſt, or made, concerning the truth in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. That the old and new covenants may be one and the ſame, and are by many, if not moſt, taken ſo to be, notwithſtanding they are called <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New, Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second,</hi> becauſe they differ in the manner of Miniſtration. So that the difference lieth in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner of adminiſtring, and not in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſpeaking the ſame of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may ſerve to clear thoſe terms about the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. <hi>John</hi> 13. 34. <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you, &amp;c.</hi> And 1 <hi>Epiſt. John</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>Brethren I write no new Commandment unto you, but an old Commandment, which ye had from the beginning.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Again a new Commandment write I unto you,</hi> &amp;c. The Commandment is <hi>old</hi> yet <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>the ſame which they had from the beginning. &amp;c.</hi> So may the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant likewiſe be taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The covenants differ, not onely in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of adminiſtring, but in the matter likewiſe, as hath been already proved, as alſo in all thoſe other particulars wherein the differences have been diſcovered. But to the Scriptures mentioned</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. I grant it to be true, if we take the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170388:17"/> Scriptures in the largeſt ſence in the words <hi>old, and from the beginning,</hi> that the commandmenr was old, as I ſhall more fully clear before I have done, and ſo was the new Covenant too, but yet diſtinguiſhed from the old.</p>
                  <p>But, Secondly, I anſwer, that the words <hi>old, and from the begnning,</hi> are diverſly to be underſtood in Scripture. Sometimes they intend the beginning of the world. Sometimes they intend the beginning of the old Teſtament miniſtration. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 166. <hi>Thy word, O Lord, is true from the beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the beginning of the Goſpel miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>John</hi> 8. 25. and 15. 27. And ſometimes from the beginning of a peoples hearing and receiving of the truth, and ſo it is in this place. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 7, 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Let that therefore abide in you, which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son and in the Father.</hi> What was it they heard from the beginning? It was the doctrine of the Goſpel, by which through believing they came into the Son and the Father, which cannot be underſtood, <hi>That which they heard from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the old Covenant.</hi> They had not then received the new, but it was that which made them one in the Son and in the Father. Therefore, The doctrine of the Goſpel. Its the very ſame words. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>An old Commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</hi> So that the truth in this ſcripture is this, That <hi>John</hi> did write no new commandment unto them, but the ſame that he had given to them when they firſt heard and received the Goſpel, which if it did abide in them, they ſhould continue in the Son and in the Father. It is in ſubſtance no more then what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. and the ſame, 2 <hi>Epiſt. John</hi> 2. 21. <hi>I have not written to you, becauſe ye know not the truth,</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170388:17"/> 
                     <hi>but becauſe ye know it. &amp;c. viz.</hi> They knew it of old, from the beginning of their reception and believing of it.</p>
                  <p>And as for the terms of old and new, they are not equivalent to the diſtinct terms about the covenants, not onely old and new covenants, as hath been minded, but <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond,</hi> the new hath made the firſt old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. The new is called a better Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. and 8. 6. All which plainly proveth two Covenants, unleſs we dare give the lie to the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures of truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The Covenant mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. is the Covenant of grace, for it is applied to the Goſpel by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5. Therefore it appears that Circumciſion, was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, for it immediately follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this chapter are both Covenants. 1. That of grace and the Goſpel covenant promiſed. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond that of circumciſion made and eſtabliſhed, under which <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed was, and therefore it much behoves us to be diligently enquiring after a right underſtanding of the will of God in Scripture, that ſo we may rightly diſtinguiſh and not confound Truth together. The want of diſtinction hath been and is the great cauſe of confuſion.</p>
                  <p>We are to know that both covenants, as hath been minded, are ſtated in this 17. <hi>chapter.</hi> The firſt or new covenant is <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou ſhalt be a father of many Nations,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>For a father of many Nations have I made thee.</hi> This is the new covenant, in which <hi>Abrams</hi> name was changed from <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to <hi>ch.</hi> 12. 3. and 15. 5. and 22. 18. And the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> that of circumciſion with the natural ſeed follows from <hi>v.</hi> 6. to <hi>v.</hi> 14. That it is ſo is clear for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as hath been already proved, was the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. is the new; therefore it muſt be thus diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:170388:18"/>
                  <p> And further, Its uſual in the Scripture to have both covenants mentioned together and ſet ſide by ſide, as it were, ſometimes one firſt, and ſometimes the other, as not onely in this place, but in <hi>chap.</hi> 22. 16, 17, 18. there is both covenants ſworn to; that is, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſpiritual ſeed, the old and the new covenants. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 33. The laſt words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in which he not onely confirms them in the old covenant, and propheſieth their breach thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> their ſin and their judgement, but likewiſe clearly ſtates the new, <hi>chap.</hi> 33. 26, 27, 28, 29. compared with <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3 The old covenant was alſo called an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant as well as the new, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18, 19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame though differingly adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, It was ſo called; yet theſe three things muſt be conſidered for the right underſtanding of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The terms of everlaſting are given to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as well as to the covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 15. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 13. And none that underſtand any thing of the Goſpel but will acknowledge that that prieſthood is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that this of the Goſpel is not the ſame, therefore it is everlaſting, <hi>viz.</hi> during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that covenant and miniſtration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The term everlaſting, as well as the old cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and all other promiſes in the old covenant were conditional, and God did not promiſe to perform either covenant or promiſe without the condition was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo that it was everlaſting, <hi>viz.</hi> while they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The old covenant, prieſthood, and promiſes were no other ways everlaſting then as they led to Chriſt, the new covenant and the everlaſting reſt, ſo they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, <hi>viz.</hi> repreſented and typed out everlaſting things, but when the ſubſtance was come the ſhadow did vaniſh away.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:170388:18"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. The Goſpel covenant is conditional as well as that of the law, as at the firſt entring into it there is the condition of believing. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark. 16. 16. and perſons continue in it on condition of continuing in the faith and obedience, and perſevering in a way of well-doing unto the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 13. And the Goſpel promiſes of life and glory are on condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. 10. and chap. 8. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, on one account it may be ſaid to be ſo, That as God never intended to ſave any but by Jeſus Chriſt, and that through faith in him and obedience to him, in perſevering in a way of well doing, all theſe conditions God had in his eternal councel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to love freely, but it was in Chriſt, and to elect and chuſe before the world was, but it was in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. And calling, and juſtifying, and glorifying, it was all done over in Gods councel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27, 30. And all that which may ſeem to be conditions, God undertakes the performance of them; and as God did <hi>elect and chuſe in Chriſt,</hi> ſo likewiſe he did chuſe them to believe and obey, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2. Yet God in the carrying on the great deſign of ſalvation in the Goſpel miniſtration, propoſeth it to us on the terms he had in his councel concluded before time, <hi>viz.</hi> faith in Chriſt, obedience, perſeverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that becauſe it is the duty of all the Lords people ſo to do, and thoſe that do it not cannot expect the grace of the covenant; yet notwithſtanding all this, faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, perſeverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a branch of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on Gods part to us, ſo that what relates to us as duty and is preſented on conditional terms, on Gods part is a branch and part of the covenant. As for faith, this is included in the covenant, <hi>I will put my Law in their minds and write it in their hearts,</hi> Heb. 8. 10. <hi>And the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170388:19"/> 
                     <hi>they that hear ſhall live,</hi> John 5. 25. The law written in the heart is the law of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and where this law is there will be perſevering in a way of well doing, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. Jeſus is ſaid to be <hi>the author and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of our faith:</hi> if ſo, then undoubtedly the whole work is effected by him, and indeed this is the life of true believers, that the Lord hath undertaken for them, and it is <hi>he that works in them to will and to do of his own good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. So that in a word, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the covenant and in the promiſes of life and glory are on ſuch conditions or terms which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is engaged for his peoples performance of, he requires of them, <hi>and works to will and to do what he requires,</hi> and yet he that doth it not muſt be damned. Here is a miniſtry that looſeth the carnal heart, and indeed in the heighth and depth of it, it is a miſterry to the Saints; but we may rather cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>How unſearchable are his Judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out.</hi> Then ſuppoſe to fathom this depth of God, let the Lords people know their duty, and continue in the faith, and perſevere to the end, looking up to the Lord, fetching ſupply of ſtrength and grace from Chriſt daily, for <hi>they are kcpt by the power of God,</hi> but it is <hi>through faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. And this glorious truth ſo full of conſolation to the truly Godly, no whit derogates from their duty, or leaves an indifferency of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or of ſpirit in them, but truly engageth their ſouls to the Lord therein, and that upon the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant account, <hi>not in the oldneſs of the letter, but in the newneſs of the ſpirit.</hi>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. This new covenant you ſpeak ſo much of is the covenant of the Kingdom, and is not yet in force. Its true, this covenant is abſolute, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have a right to it, and to glory, but the time is not yet come of being in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If believers are not in this, they are in no covenant, for there are but two, <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new, firſt</hi> and

                     <hi>ſecond.</hi> Now that this covenant is in being is evident, for, 1. the Apoſtle maketh the application of it to the Goſpel time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and proves it to be in force, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 16, 17. <hi>Becauſe the teſtator is dead, a covenant or Teſtament is in force when the teſtator is dead.</hi> And in my text, <hi>He taketh away the firſt, that be may eſtabliſh the ſecond;</hi> and indeed to deny this covenant to be in force, is to deny the <hi>blood</hi> of the covenant and death of the teſtator.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture titles are ſafeſt and ſoundeſt; its called the <hi>firſt</hi> covenant, and the old covenant, as hath been already cleared with the grounds thereof: And further in the Scripture light we may ſafely call it an <hi>Additional</hi> covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the law? It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, till the ſeed ſhnold come, to whom the Promiſes was made.</hi> The law was the old covenant, as hath been proved. It is ſometimes called the covenant, ſometimes the law; ſo that it is all one, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, the covenant was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, but—</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> The quaere may be to what it was added?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture ſeems to gather in two things to which it was added, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. it was added to that which was given to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, though that and this be all one in the nature of it, <hi>viz.</hi> both condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, yet this is branched forth into many parts, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and duties are many. And that it was added to that is clear from theſe words, <hi>becauſe of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>That ſin by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment might become exceeding ſinful;</hi> That is, that ſinful ſtate, and thoſe ſinful actions which flow from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170388:20"/> thence, that we all fell into in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as is at large reaſoned, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. Now man being fallen into ſuch a ſtate of ſinning and death, the law or old Covenant was added to that given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice becauſe of tranſgreſſion, that the ſins committed in the ſinful ſtate by the tranſgreſſion of one man might appear <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful, and all mens mouths might be ſtopped, and the whole world might become guilty before God,</hi> in the ſence of their ſinfulneſs by nature and practice, and their own inability to ſave themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The old covenant was added to the promiſe of the new. This is likewiſe clear: it was added <hi>till the ſeed was come to whom the promiſe was made,</hi> therefore the law was added till this ſeed was come; Added to what? to the promiſe of the ſeed, till the ſeed was come, and ſo it was <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. as hath been already proved. There is firſt the promiſe of the bleſſing to the Nations, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt be a father of many Nations,</hi> viz. Of all believers in all the Nations in the new covenant in the ſeed, Chriſt, this muſt be, and then adds the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> of circumciſion to the promiſe, and that becauſe of tranſgreſſion, that there might be a law to diſcover ſin till the ſeed was come, and to require righteouſneſs and obedience, that it might be a type of the righteouſneſs and deliverance from ſin in the new covenant by the true ſeed to whom the promiſe was made.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, doubtleſs it was, and there was never any ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation but by vertue of the new covenant in Chriſt, it was made and lay in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and 12. 3. brought forth into an oath, <hi>chap.</hi> 22. 18. Yet the new and old covenants kept clearly diſtinct throughout all the time of that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, inſomuch that few of them in the old underſtood the new. God made the new covenant
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170388:20"/> firſt with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. 3. but the old came firſt into a miniſtration as an additional covenant till the ſeed was come, to which the new was made.

That <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> were <hi>an allegory of the two Covenants,</hi> they were both in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe at once, and the free woman was there before the bond, but the bondwoman bare ſeed firſt. So it was in the Covenants. And the new covenant was miniſtred through the old, as it typed out Jeſus Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired righteouſneſs and made Promiſes, and virtually it was doubtleſs to the ſalvation of all Gods elect; for as the elect obtained it when Chriſt came, and the reſt were blinded. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. ſo it was before in the Typical covenant they had Chriſt and the new Covenant held forth, eſpecially 1.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doubtleſs he was as to come, for ſo the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant though made, yet lay in Promiſe, and they were to look for the ſeed to whom the Promiſe was made. And ſo the Covenant, Mediator and all, lay in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and they were ſaved by that Covenant, as Jeſus was conſidered to be the Mediator of it. Hence they muſt have a typicall Mediator, as well as covenant in both to lead to a Covenant and Mediator <hi>(viz.</hi> Chriſt) to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Was the Covenant made with Chriſt onely, or with him and all the elect? or are we to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. the Promiſes to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, was to Chriſt Perſonal or to Chriſt Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt and all his myſtical body?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Covenant was made firſt, and chiefly with Chriſt perſonally, as the head of the body the Church, and in him, with all his body and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof. <hi>Iſay</hi> 59. 21. but eſpecially, and firſt with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170388:21"/> Chriſt perſonally. So the Covenant and Promiſes <hi>to Abraham in his ſeed,</hi> was Chriſt Perſonally, he was the ſeed to whom the Promiſes were made, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Now to Abraham and his ſeed were the Promiſes made, he ſaith not to ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed which is Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The covenant and Promiſes was to Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it would be improper to underſtand it otherwiſe: for the Promiſe to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, was, that <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 22. 18. If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by ſeed in this place the ſeed myſticall, <hi>viz.</hi> all the elect, then we muſt read it thus, that in Chriſt and all the elect the nations ſhall be bleſſed: then who wil there be in the nations to be bleſſed by thus ſeed the underſtood? for the <hi>wicked,</hi> though they <hi>live an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, yet they muſt be accurſed, Iſay</hi> 65. 20. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>ſeed</hi> is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the bleſſing by him came forth to us Gentiles and all nations, <hi>viz.</hi> All that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him are bleſſed, and none elſe. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>That the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is the bleſſing that God promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould come on the Nations (that is the Gentiles) in his ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through faith.</hi> Its ſaid further, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>that this covenant was confirmed before of God in Chriſt,</hi> and therefore could not be <hi>diſanulled by the law, viz.</hi> the law or covenant from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> could not prevent the coming forth of Chriſt, and ſo make void the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and bleſſing promiſed to the Nations in Chriſt the true ſeed, ſo that we are to diſtinguiſh (though not divide) between Chriſt the true ſeed as the head, and his body the Church as members. They are in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called the ſeed, or <hi>children</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Iſay</hi> 59. 21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 30. &amp; 89. 29, 30. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13. So that in a word the covenant is made with Chriſt, and in him the bleſſing of the covenant comes forth to all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170388:21"/> his People, and by faith they come to claim their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this covenant of free and rich grace, wrought forth and brought to light in and by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in whom all the Promiſes are yea, and Amen, to the Praiſe and Glory of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20.</p>

                  <p>Therefore I ſay, that it is done away, firſt as it was a covenant from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſo it is clear turned out and hath no place in the Goſpel, even as <hi>Hagar,</hi> the old covenant in an <hi>Allegory</hi> muſt out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24, 25, 30. <hi>Caſt out the Bondwoman and her ſon, for the ſon of the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the Free woman.</hi> So that, when the free woman is come to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the bond woman with her ſon muſt be caſt out.</p>

                  <p>And ſecondly, as it was a miniſtration by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo its done away and aboliſhed, and is not to be preached or received (as in the hand of <hi>Moſes)</hi> as it was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred forth, received and obeyed in the old Teſtament. For it was miniſtred then on life and death, and was (through mans weakneſs) a miniſtration of death, and not of life. So that I underſtand all thoſe expreſſions to relate to thoſe heads or Particulars, when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, That the Law is <hi>aboliſhed</hi> and <hi>done away,</hi> that believers are <hi>dead</hi> to it, <hi>delivered from it, are not under it,</hi> and that <hi>the Bond woman muſt be caſt out with her ſon.</hi>

But Jeſus Chriſt having fulfilled all its righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, having born the curſe for us,</p>
                  <p>Its a Rule of righteouſneſs, of converſation to the honour of him that hath done all for us in point of juſtification to eternal life. And ſo its become a law of love, a royal law of liberty to all that are by faith in the new covenant, and a law to which every believer is in bounden duty to Jeſus Chriſt, to own as his precious rule of life to honour him by, as it is given forth by him in the Goſpel and no otherwiſe.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 As it differs in the work, ſo alſo in the ends, and that in two things, 1. The old covenant faith was not their righteouſneſs, nor was it imputed to them as their righteouſneſs, but they were required to believe that they might do the covenant, and that was their righteouſneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>and this ſhall be your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs if ye obſerve and do all theſe commands,</hi> the old covenant repentance was for the avoiding of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by the ſword, and cutting off out of the Land of <hi>Canaan, Iſa.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 32. <hi>Wherefore turn your ſelves and live ye.</hi> The new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant faith and repentance leads to Jeſus, who is our righteouſneſs, hence the new covenant righteouſneſs is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 13. <hi>and his faith is counted for righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4, 5. which was not in the old covenant, but a righteouſneſs of works, not that faith doth juſtifie. But 1. as its the work and all the work on mans part in order to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and is likewiſe the gift of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>And ſecond as it believes the truth of God on the Goſpel account as the eye and hand of the ſoul, to eye and apply Jeſus Chriſt crucified, who is our juſtification and our life.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond end of the old covenant faith &amp; repentance, was, that they thereby might have a life in the outward land; the bleſſing of life in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as hath been already proved.</p>
                  <p>But the faith and repentance of the new covenant is in order to, and receives an intereſt in eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 5. 24. and 6. 47. Thus the old and new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants differ in their faith, and repentance: Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>before faith came we were kept under the law; ſhut up unto the faith that</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:170388:23"/> 
                     <hi>ſhould afterward be revealed.</hi> And again, <hi>the law is not of faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. That is, did not hold out juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith in Jeſus, as the new covenant doth.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding there was new covenant faith and repentance in thoſe that were for eternal life, even under the law; though not of the law.</p>
                  <p>But as the new covenant was adminiſtred then in promiſes, types, and prophecies, ſo there was a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then that had the faith of, or in the new coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. <hi>Abraham longed to ſee the day of Chriſt, and he ſaw it, and rejoyced.</hi> And the truth is, that the old covenant never brought eternal life to any, <hi>for if there had been a law given which could have given life, then verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the law,</hi> Gal. 3. 21. So that that which we are to underſtand in theſe Scriptures, <hi>that the law is not of faith,</hi> and <hi>before faith came,</hi> &amp;c. is plain. Faith was not come, as now it is, and that on three accounts. 1. As the new covenant was darkly adminiſtred, therefore was their faith very low, and dark at the higheſt, it muſt be on Chriſt to come: ours is on Chriſt already come, and the work done by him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This truth ſerves for a word of information and that on ſeveral accounts, not onely to inform us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That there are indeed, and in truth, two cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new, firſt</hi> and <hi>ſccond,</hi> which hath been clearly, proved. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the <hi>old</hi> is <hi>done away,</hi> and the <hi>new remains,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> is <hi>aboliſhed</hi> the <hi>ſecond eſtabliſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alſo thirdly, It may fully inform us of the great miſtakes that have been in the world, and are at this day amongſt moſt about the covenants, judging them to be but one and the ſame, differing onely in manner of adminiſtring. And doubtleſs, this grand miſtake hath been an in let to many dangerous miſtakes in matters of Religion, and the things of God, but you will ſay,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are the miſtakes that have been and yet remain in this matter?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt I ſhall mention, is about the ſeed of the covenant, from the miſtake about the covenant, taking the <hi>new</hi> to be the ſame with the <hi>old,</hi> men have brought in the old Teſtament ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſeed of the fleſh, the natural ſeed of (ſuppoſed) Believers into (as they call it) the Church. So that here hath been a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great miſtake and errour in this very thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the danger of this miſtake and errour?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It altogether makes void the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Goſpel, keeps up the old in ſtead of the new. Its a principle and practiſe that doth as much as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170388:25"/> in men lies (in act) flatly deny the new covenant, and bids defiance to it, for that is with the ſpiritual ſeed. See what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in this matter, and let him that hears or reads, lay it to heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none effect.</hi> Hear and tremble, ye that fear God, that have through miſtake made the ſeed of the law to be heirs, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſhly ſeed; that is, the ſeed of the law. It is to make ſaith void and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of none effect. It makes void faith and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for it brings into the covenant by natural genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, the ſeed of the law of the fleſh, and the way of coming into that covenant, and who ever pretends to bring into the new covenant by natural generation deſtroys faith and the covenant, for the new covenant owns not the natural ſeed, Jew or Gentile, but the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and they enter into it by faith: <hi>viz.</hi> as to the right of claiming intereſt, this the other makes void, this is the firſt danger.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It hath been an occaſion of turning aſide from Gods way in receiving members into the ſuppoſed Church of Chriſt. Whereas Chriſts Rule is by faith and Baptiſm, this hath brought in by natural birth and ſprinkling, and hath brought a generall odium and contempt upon Chriſts ordinance of dipping or bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing believers in his name, after the manifeſtation of faith and repentance, a ſin which many that arc (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) precious have cauſe enough to <hi>repent</hi> of and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail, that <hi>their hand ſhould be chief in ſuch a treſpaſs</hi> as this is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It hath been an inſtrumental means of deceiving millions of poor ſouls brought into the name of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> on the old covenant account, and ſo being deluded periſh under the name of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> without the <hi>Power.</hi> Doubtleſs there will be a ſad account for ſome one day for this very thing, and its one (among many) of the greateſt grounds of lamentation, I know of, this day in the world.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170388:26"/>
                  <p> And as the Nominal Clergy, have had, and yet have the greateſt hand in this treſpaſs, yet if God open their eyes to ſee into this great truth, and their great miſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage herein, certainly they will forbear their harſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for my plainneſs and zeal in this matter. The Lord knows, I do judge many among them (in the main) to be godly. But its my great grief, and burden, that godly men (through miſtake) ſhould have a hand in ſuch a work as this is, the Lord help them to lay it to heart in time.</p>
                  <p>In a word here lyeth the foundation of all miſtakes. Rightly to underſtand the covenant would rectifie all differences among all ſorts of Profeſſing people. This is it hath brought in carnal ſeed, carnal miniſtery, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal means of attaining to it, and all to keep up carnal ends and intereſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Of exhortation, and oh that it might prevail to exhort and ſtirre you up to a more diligent ſearch and enquirie into the covenants, that you may be able to diſtinguiſh between law and Goſpel. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Without the knowledge of the difference, or at leaſt ſome clear inſight into the Goſpel covenant, you can never live clearly the life of faith, but at beſt it will be with you as with the godly before Chriſt came, a mixing of old and new together: you can never be able miniſters of the new covenant, unleſs you are able to diſtinguiſh between <hi>new</hi> and <hi>old,</hi> that ſo you may be miniſters of the new.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Without this, you will never come clearly off the Babyloniſh apoſtacy. Want of being cleared in this leaves you behinde (at leaſt) in part: come clear in this one truth, and come away clear; come to the clearneſs of the new covenant and keep <hi>in</hi> the carnal ſeed if you can, and the ſprinkling of Infants, and the carnal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and maintenance (I mean out of Chriſts way that he hath appointed) come to the new covenant, and be a free willer, if thou canſt, nay or a Quaker either. I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170388:26"/> ſay again its ſuch a truth, and of ſuch concernment, that it behooves you as you love God, your own ſouls would be delivered from errour, live to God here, give up your account with joy in the day of accounts. I ſay, it behooves you to be deeply and diligently enquiring into the knowledge of the new covenant. I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that there is ſuch a neceſſity for every believer to be able to give ſo exact an account of the difference, but that it concerns every believer to know, that they are <hi>two</hi> and <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and to be inquiring into the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as much as may be, and let men of learning and natural parts, take heed how they do endeavour any longer to darken this truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Some may object and ſay, If the covenant be of ſuch power as you ſpeak of, as to effect what it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whence then comes it that godly people ſhould be ignorant of it, and what need is there ſo earneſtly to exhort to the enquiring into it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The covenant is free, and full of power, and effects what it requires, it is ſo in the firſt work of grace, and converting ſinners; 1 hence it is, that the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſay</hi> 65. 1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that ſought me not,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>The dead ſhall hear the voice of the ſon of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> Yet after God in the new Covenant hath communicated life to dead ſouls, he expects that they ſhould know from whence their life comes, and ſeek him, and wait upon him, in the way that he hath appointed diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after his will that they may know it, and do it. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. God having in the former part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) promiſed what great and good things he would do for his People according to the new covenant, yet <hi>ver.</hi> 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. <hi>If thou crieſt after knowledge and lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding; if thou ſeekeſt her</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:170388:27"/> 
                     <hi>as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſure, then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeking is a great and ſpecial duty of Saints in the new covenant, and God will be found in this way of ſeeking and doing his will; yet notwithſtanding the ignorance and miſcariage of the Lords people (thoſe that are in the new covenant indeed) ſhall not deſtroy and damne them, yet it may bring them under judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and afflictions, and will prove their loſs in the great day of account, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30, 31, 32. <hi>For if we would judge our ſelves we ſhould not be judged, but when we are judged we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> Chap. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>If any man build upon the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Jeſus Chriſt, gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, wood, hay, ſtubble; if his work abide he ſhall receive a reward. If any mans work ſhall be burnt he ſhall ſuffer loſs, but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi> So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the covenant is a ſure covenant to thoſe in it, and full of power, yet it requires diligence and ſeeking in Gods way, and doing his will, without which God may let his own people miſcarry, and in ſo doing they will be ſure to ſuffer loſs in the judgement although they may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the ſecond leſſon from the Text. The firſt truth being cleared, that the Scripture doth preſent us with two covenants, the ſecond follows.</p>

                  <p>And indeed it was the great deſign of God in ſending Chriſt to effect the work, the ending of the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the eſtabliſhing of the ſecond.</p>

                     <item>7 The Application of the whole.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, namely, to prove the truth from Scripture, that Chriſt hath taken away the firſt and eſtabliſhed the ſecond covenant. My grounds to prove it are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Scripture witneſſeth it: the text is clear and full: He taketh away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>In that he ſaith a new, he hath made the fiſt old, now that which decayeth and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. 11. 13. The Apoſtle clearly ſtates the two covenants, the one he calls the Letter, the other he calls the Spirit.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170388:28"/> The old <hi>that</hi> was written in tables of ſtone, and done away and aboliſhed. The new, that of the Spirit which remains as moſt glorious and abiding, in all which Scriptures the truth preſented is fully and plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle applieth the new covenant to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time and ſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. to 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 15. all which prove it to be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The death of the Teſtator proves it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtator.</hi> ver. 17. <hi>For a Teſtament is of force after men are dead.</hi> This the Apoſtle urgeth to prove the new Teſtament to be of force, becauſe Chriſt is dead.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it concerns men to take heed how they deny this covenant to be in force, for to deny the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is to deny the death of the Teſtator, and to deny that, is to deny the Goſpel. Oh, therefore let men take heed how they deny the eſtabliſhment of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Chriſt is the mediator of this covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. and he is not a mediator of a covenant not in force, ſo that indeed to deny this new covenant to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, is no leſs then to deny the mediatorſhip of Chriſt: for a mediator, muſt be a mediator of ſome covenant or other, and the old is done away, that was not of grace but of works. And the new is eſtabliſhed, of which Chriſt is the mediator. So that Chriſt muſt be the mediator of this new covenant, or of no covenant, which I believe none that fear the Lord dare to deny.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What this ſecond, or new covenant is: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have already in the diſtinguiſhing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants ſpoken to this, I ſhall more diſtinctly in this place, come to ſpeak of the new covenant what it is.</p>
                  <p>And for my more clear handling of this great Goſpel truth I ſhall
<list>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170388:28"/>
                        <item>1. Diſtinctly ſtate the covenant by it ſelf.</item>
                        <item>2. In its parts,</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſo every true believer may not onely come right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand the covenant, but likewiſe to draw ſuch conſolation from it, as God hath intended in it for his people; for I do believe that darkneſs in this myſtery, hath occaſioned many precious ſouls to loſe very much of the precious conſolation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Covenant then is,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gods engagement and promiſe in Jeſus Chriſt, in way of covenant and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>th, freely to do for, work in, and give to his people all things that may tend to make them truly and eternally happy and bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>To prove this to be the new and Goſpel Covenant, I muſt have recourſe unto <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and <hi>chap.</hi> 22. 18. where is the covenant moſt lively ſtated, and made to and with <hi>Abraham</hi> in Promiſe, as it was to be promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated when the fulneſs of time was come, <hi>viz. In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>ch.</hi> 22. 18. God upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience in offering his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> (a lively type of Chriſt, the true ſeed that was to be offered) brings up his covenant into an oath, and ſware to <hi>Abraham</hi> that he would performe it, that in thy ſeed ſhall all nations be bleſſed, that is, truly and eternally bleſſed. Hence it is that in the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the bleſſing is eternal life, not onely life as in the old, but eternal life. And doubtleſs, there is no bleſſing ſpiritual or eternal that the Saints are intereſted in, but it is the bleſſing of this covenant, and as God freely gives bleſſedneſs in this covenant, ſo he works all things in his people in order to do it, without which they could not be bleſſed; and that is evident in the promiſe of this covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. That is, I will work a willing mind in them, to what ever I do require of them in order
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170388:29"/> to their true and eternal bleſſedneſs. This is the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that God in Chriſt <hi>(the true ſeed)</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted all his people in. Hence it is ſaid that God made this covenant in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>But ſecond, I ſhall come to open the covenant in its parts, that ſo by faith we may ſuch the ſweetneſs of this honey, and feed upon the marrow and fatneſs of the new covenant bleſſings; for I do believe that there is not one promiſe, I mean Goſpel promiſe, to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but it is either a branch of, or is ſtated in or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the new covenant.</p>
                  <p>The branches or parts of the new covenant lie mainly, as hath been minded, in theſe three heads.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Doing for

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. What he hath done for his people on the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant account, conſiſts eſpecially in theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He loved them freely, and that while they were enemies: a wonderful mercy indeed! He loved them before they were, and ſo before they had any love to him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, bath quickned us together with Chriſt.</hi> Note, Gods love was a great love to his people, even when they were dead in ſin. Hence it is that God ſaith, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Some may ſay this was ſpoken of old <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under the old covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its clear that God is diſcovering in <hi>chap.</hi> 30. and 31. what he will do for them by virtue of the new covenant, which is not yet performed, and 2. we may truly reaſon thus, that if Gods love were from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to them in that covenant, much more is it in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170388:29"/> the new covenant; we may reaſon in this as the Apoſtle doth about the old.</p>

                        </gap> from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good works.</hi> And God having given us his Son, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Here is the exceeding riches of Gods grace to his Sons and Daughters, that he hath given his own onely beloved Son for them, that they might have life through him: And this is the great grace of God in the new covenant. God hath not onely given Chriſt for his people, but he hath alſo wrought faith in them by the word, and ſo hath applied Chriſt to them. This is the rich grace of our God, and all upon the account of the new, or ſecond covenant.</p>
                  <p>For the word of the Goſpel publiſheth theſe <hi>Glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> and the Lord by that word worketh faith, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170388:30"/> believeth and applieth the truth of the Doctrine of the Goſpel. For faith is the law that God in the covenant did promiſe to <hi>write in the hearts of his people,</hi> Jer. 31. 32. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. Hence it is that faith is ſaid to be the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Ye are ſaved by grace through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay that its grace, thats the gift of God in that place, and not faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is <hi>Faith that is the gift of God</hi> in this place, for though it be true that grace is the gift of God, yet in this place its faith that is intended to be the gift, for to underſtand it to be grace, is contrary to all reaſon, Divine or Humane, and it muſt needs be much folly and wrong to the Spirit ſo to underſtand it: for then it muſt be thus read and underſtood, <hi>Ye are ſaved by grace, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> But ſo to read and underſtand it, theſe three abſurdities will neceſſarily follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith muſt be left out, and ſo the word which is clearly the relative to the concluſion taken away. Its clear that the concluſion relates to faith; <hi>Through faith and that not of your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Faith being that which immediately precedes, and likewiſe is brought forth, as in clear conjunction to and with, that word guilt of God by a copulative Conjunction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was a common known truth that grace was of God, and not of our ſelves: and the very word <hi>Grace,</hi> imports the excluſion of ſelf, ſo that it would have been a Tautology to have added not <hi>of your ſelves,</hi> it is the gift of God, to grace, and its contrary to the uſual way of the Spirits bringing forth of truth by his ſervants; but when he ſpeaks of grace he ſets it in direct oppoſition to works when ever we finde ſalvation by grace minded. It carrieth ſo much in it, that it is of God &amp; not of ſelf. It is a word that in it ſelf doth abſolutely ſeparate the work of ſalvation from ſelf and placeth it in God, and therefore it cannot be reaſonably imagined that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170388:30"/> intends in this place grace to be the gift of God, but faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So to underſtand it muſt not onely argue the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle weak in ſpeaking Tautologies, but the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> exceeding weak and ignorant, that they need to be informed that <hi>grace</hi> was not of themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>grace</hi> by which they muſt be ſaved, which I do judge that there is never a carnal man that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſound of grace, but underſtands that it is not of themſelves: for the word <hi>grace</hi> imports as much as the love and favour of God, and this muſt be of God, and not of our ſelves; but many ſelfiſh men think that it is of themſelves to attain this grace through faith. And many believing men, I fear, are too much tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this miſtake, and this is it the Apoſtle either rectifieth or endeavoureth to prevent in this place. <hi>Ye are ſaved by grace through faith, and this faith is not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, for he is the authour and finiſher of it,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. So that God hath not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to work faith, but to preſerve and keep his people in the new covenant, he is the finiſher of their faith, as well as the authour of it;—but to proceed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath greatly enriched this new covenant with all bleſſings, and greatly enriched his people in this covenant; for he hath with Chriſt and faith and intereſt, given to them all things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remiſſion of ſins: this is to be preached and is freely given in the new covenant. This is one ſpecial part of the Goſpel, and branch of the covenant of grace, remiſſion of ſins by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſins was to be preached in his name among all nations.</hi> And as it is to be preached in the name of Chriſt, ſo it is adminiſtred and applied to all true believers; and this is ſuch grace that we do not onely need it in our firſt converſion and work of faith, for <hi>the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt,</hi> Rom. 3 25. but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170388:31"/> all the time we live here, as ſin remains and cleaves to us, ſo we need remiſſion, and in the new covenant it is adminiſtred to us according to the tenour therein expreſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. 1 <hi>Epiſt. John</hi> 2. 12. and chap. 1. 9. In all which this bleſſing or bleſſed gift is clearly ſtated; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Peace and reconciliation with himſelf is another bleſſing of the new covenant, which the Lord gives to all his people, and this peace is likewiſe firſt preached in the doctrine of the Goſpel. Hence it is that God ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 19. <hi>I create the fruit of</hi> the lips, Peace, Peace, to him that is far off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord. And Chriſt ſent his Diſciples with the meſſage of peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 10: 5. and the Apoſtles came <hi>preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, who is Lord of all,</hi> Acts 10. 36. and this peace and reconciliation is applied and injoyed by faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>Ye who ſometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt, for he is our peace.</hi> Rom. 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The bleſſing of the Spirit is another bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the new covenant, and truly included in that bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abraham:</hi> for there is nothing that tends to make the Saints truly and eternally bleſſed, but it muſt be included in that bleſſing promiſed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> without which perſons could not be bleſſed; therefore this of the ſpirit is reckoned as one of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not the leaſt neither, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>That the bleſsing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith.</hi> This is the great Goſpel bleſſing and promiſe of Chriſt when he was <hi>to leave this world and go to the Father,</hi> that he would ſend the <hi>holy ſpirit the comforter,</hi> which promiſe believers now have a ſhare in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. <hi>As for me, this is my covenant,</hi> &amp;c. The refore let the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170388:31"/> Saints be encouraged to expect ſuch a portion of his promiſed Spirit as may concur to the effecting of Gods covenant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The adoption of ſons by the ſame ſpirit is another bleſſing of the new covenant, for out of Chriſt men are ſtrangers, enemies, but in Chriſt, friends, Sons, and daughters, to the Lord God Almighty. Oh friends, here is a bleſſing and a bleſſed priviledge the Lord hath given to his people in this new covenant, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, even to as many as believe in his name,</hi> 1 John 3. 1. <hi>Behold, what manner of love is this which the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God; and if Sons, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and Joynt-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. Oh learn to improve this priviledge and this intereſt in, and relation to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. An intereſt in great and precious promiſes both of grace and glory. This the Lord gives in this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to all his people, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes,</hi> &amp;c. Oh, the great and precious promiſes relating both to grace and glory, that God hath intereſted his people in, in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; every New Teſtament Promiſe is a branch of the Covenant, and muſt be performed. Promiſes of pardoning, and purging, and ſupporting, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, Promiſes of the kingdom and the glory that is yet to come, this hath God promiſed in the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and given his people an intereſt in, the <hi>godly have the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come.</hi> Oh, Therefore let them learn to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more with the promiſes, and more to prize them, and to live by faith in the expectation of Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in performing of them, for they are his peoples por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till they come to enjoy the <hi>Promiſed poſſeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Free acceſs to the throne of grace as Sons and Daughters in the name of Chriſt, a great and precious
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170388:32"/> favour, too little prized and improved by the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. God delights to have his children come to him, and call upon him in the ſpirit and faith of ſons: this is the Lords gift, and it is marvellous that he ſhould admit ſuch worthleſs worms to come to him with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Oh let us learn to prize it and improve it, its a new Covenant mercy, that which none can claim a right in but believers; Its their priviledge, its their duty, let them therefore know it, and be incouraged to come with boldneſs to the throne of grace. Never a carnal man in the World can claim a right to this as a new Covenant mercy. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. 16. <hi>To the wicked God ſaid, What haſt thou to do to take my covenant into thy mouth?</hi> &amp;c. Let not the Lords people be found negligent in this work, nor undervaluing it as a low and legal thing: but know it is a high and precious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, be ye therefore faithful in the improving of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Outward comforts of this life, are given in as new covenant mercies, although the great promiſes on which the covenant is eſtabliſhed, are ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and not ſuch on which the old covenant was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, yet the new covenant is not altogether without the promiſes of this life. Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. and <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 31. your heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth that ye have need of theſe things, and all theſe things ſhall be added, <hi>viz.</hi> added in, with, and to the kingdom. Its true, our Lord hath not promiſed great things in this life to his people, but <hi>food and cloathing.</hi> Therefore having <hi>that</hi> which God hath promiſed, <hi>let us be therewith content, for we brought nothing with us into this world, and it is certain, we ſhall carry nothing out.</hi> And let us learn to enjoy all our mercies, as handed to us in the new covenant, upon the account of Chriſt, and improve all for God, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon our Iuſts, but be faithfull in anſwering Gods precious ends, in imbracing ſuch worthleſs worms
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170388:32"/> in ſuch an inriching covenant as this is, in which both grace and glory are included.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I ſhall come to ſhew you the nature of this new covenant, which is thus eſtabliſhed by Chriſt.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <p n="1">1 It is a free covenant. Oh the freeneſs of Gods love in this covenant: this covenant is free,</p>

                  <p>Firſt, relating to God, it was free, his own councel and purpoſe of grace freely conceived it in himſelf, and brought forth by, and of himſelf. Such was the freeneſs of the love of God in this covenant, that nothing could put a ſtop to him, notwithſtanding he foreſaw what man would be, and do; yet this put no ſtop to the free coming forth of this covenant, all the parts of it are free. <hi>His doing for, working in, and giving to,</hi> are all free. Chriſt a free gift, ſo is the work of faith. <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, Jam.</hi> 1. 18.

                  <p n="2">2 It is free in relation to man, there being nothing in us to procure it, neither of deſert or deſire after it, which puts a very great luſtre and beauty in the grace of the covenant, that is extended to ſuch worthleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not deſiring their own good: but would rather have choſen the way of ſin and death, then the way of righteouſneſs and life, if mercy had not prevented. The Lord meets with poor ſouls in a way of mercy, when they are poſting headlong to hell and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is a powerful covenant; it effecteth what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in point of power, it requireth faith and gives power to believe, it requireth obedience, and gives power to obey, <hi>viz.</hi> God in it and by it doth effect it, for God is the power of this covenant, as the grace of making, ſo the power of effecting belongs to God.

Oh, let the Saints learn to live by faith more in the Goſpel power and ſtrength, which is able to keep them unto that day. See <hi>Iſay</hi> 40. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Its an holy covenant, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 72. <hi>To remember his holy covenant.</hi> And that not onely in the matter of it, ſo was the old a holy covenant, <hi>The commandement is holy juſt and good:</hi> but this is holy as it effects, and works holineſs in thoſe who are gathered into it, and this the other did not.

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:170388:34"/> we are to underſtand the elect and choſen of God in Chriſt before the world was (according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) whether Jew or Gentile.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Of the Jew conſider and compare the Scripture, and it will appear that although God hath made many promiſes unto the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to do them good, and they are all branches of this covenant, yet they are to them not as natural, but ſpiritual, even the elect of God. Therefore not general to all the ſeed, but to <hi>a remnant whom the Lord ſhall call, Joel</hi> 2. 32. in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. a Remnant ſhall be ſaved, and explains this remnant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>So then there is a remnant at this preſent time according to the election of grace.</hi> ver. 7. <hi>the election obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</hi> So that as there was a remnant at that time, even ſo there ſhall be a remnant, in a time yet to come, that God will bring in of that people, <hi>but not by their Covenant (viz.</hi> as a nation from mount <hi>Sinai)</hi> but by the covenant of grace, where the elect obtains it according to the word of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>That all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the elect out of all the tribes, which are <hi>the Remnant whom the Lord will call,</hi> It can be no other. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is ſo minded in relation to the Remnant then called of the two tribes, but there is a time yet to come, that God will gather in, out of all the tribes. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2 We muſt ſo underſtand this as concording with other Scriptures, which ſaith it ſhall be but a <hi>Remnant,</hi> even <hi>a tenth, the holy feed, the ſubſtance thereof,</hi> Iſay. 6. 13.</p>
                  <p>And ſo among the Gentiles, great are the Promiſes to the Gentiles and the grace revealed, yet the elect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, and the ſheep in Gods councel and Chriſts knowledge muſt be brought in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23, 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 16. So that in a word the covenant is made to the elect
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170388:35"/> in Chriſt, and effected in and with believers, whether Jew or Gentile, which is the</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>Fourth particular, with whom the covenant is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and that is with Jeſus Chriſt, and in him with all the elect, and by him, eſtabliſhed for the elect, and accompliſhed in and with them in his times.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is with Jeſus Chriſt as the head, he being the foundation of Gods election and choice. <hi>Iſay</hi> 42. 1. <hi>The firſt born among many brethren,</hi> Rom. 8. 29. <hi>That in all things he might have the preheminence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this covenant was firſt made with Chriſt, is clear from the Scripture. If we take it as given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the covenant was with his ſeed perſonally (that is) Chriſt, as hath been before proved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 16. <hi>The promiſe was made to Abraham and his ſeed: he ſaith not ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt,</hi> ſo that the covenant is clearly ſtated to and with Jeſus Chriſt, and is with and in him, hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that all the promiſes are in him yea and amen, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. now all the promiſes are branches of the covenant, and the covenant being with and in him, all the promiſes muſt be in him, and in him <hi>ſure, yea, and Amen, to the praiſe and glory of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And farther, if we conſider <hi>David</hi> as perſonating Chriſt, the covenant was with him. <hi>God hath ſworn by his holineſs he will not lye to David, viz.</hi> to Chriſt, but his covenant ſhall ſtand <hi>faſt for ever.</hi> So that Chriſt ſtands <hi>head</hi> in this Covenant to his <hi>body the Church.</hi> And as this covenant is made with Chriſt, it is in behalf of all the elect. Chriſt hath covenanted here in behalf of all the elect, note this. And that,</p>

And it is a giving by covenant, as is clearly expreſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. 39. <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> Here is the fathers will, and Chriſt came to do it, ſo that here is Chriſts will, and the covenant and agreement between the father and the ſon, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came down from heaven. <hi>For I came down from heaven, ſaith Chriſt, to do the wil of him that ſent me.</hi> The father purpoſeth the work and the termes on which it muſt be undertaken; Chriſt accepts it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it. The firſt part of it is to bring in all that the Father hath given him, <hi>they ſhall come to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> All are given to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true all are given to him, but to differing ends. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> But the gift we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of is a gift by covenant, in a way of grace, ſo a remnant are given to Chriſt, and ſhall come to him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Other ſheep I have that are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring in, &amp;c.</hi> That is his elect among the Gentiles, yea all that Chriſt was to bring to God from among the Gentiles, are here included, and they were his ſheep before they were born, and before converſion. How his, but by gift, in way of covenant? and Chriſt muſt bring them in, and why? to anſwer the will the covenant on this behalf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For preſervation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28, 29. <hi>They ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of mine hand. My father which gave them me, is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand.</hi> They are in the ſons hand by way of gift and covenant, in the fathers hand in way of power, the power of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170388:36"/> father and the ſon being one and the ſame in working, therefore the father worketh, and the ſon worketh. Chriſt holdeth them faſt, and the father holdeth them faſt, who is greater then all, and his greatneſs is manifeſt in the ſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39. It is the fathers will that Chriſt ſhould <hi>loſe nothing of all that he had given him, but that he raiſe it up and make it good at the laſt day,</hi> and this is Chriſts will too, this is the covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For the donation and giving of the kingdom and the glory, this Chriſt hath undertaken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>and I give them eternal life and they ſhall never periſh, and chap.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life, to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> This is the fathers will in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Chriſt accepts it: it is his will too, and ſo Chriſt comes into the world about the work and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth this covenant for the elect, that they might be brought into it, and have their ſhare in it, in his times.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>And this is the truth we are upon: That Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed this covenant for his elect, and doth manifeſt it to them in his times in the work of faith, and now the covenant is ſaid to be made with them for two Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe now they give conſent to it, and reſign up themſelves to the Lord in what he hath done for them: and believe the grace and the covenant of grace, now there is their acceptation of what Chriſt hath done, and juſtifying him in the work, together with their reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves up to him as their head and Lord, in this bleſſed and holy covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They come now to claim a right in the covenant, which before they could not do, though God and Chriſt had a ſpeciall right in them, yet they could claim no right by covenant in the father and the ſon, before or without believing, and this is Chriſts work, to work faith in all his elect, <hi>He is the author and finiſher of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:170388:36"/>
                  <p> I come now to the fifth particular, namely the way by which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed this covenant, and that is by his blood. Oh friends in this undertaking of Jeſus Chriſt for poor ſinners, this covenant muſt be by blood, there muſt of neceſſity be <hi>the death of the Teſtator.</hi> Hence it is called <hi>a Covenant that is by blood,</hi> Zach. 9. 11. And the blood of Chriſt is called the blood of the covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. And Chriſt ſaith, This is the Cup of the New Teſtament in my blood, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. And you will finde that the blood of Chriſt <hi>(viz.</hi> Chriſt crucified, his body and blood broken and ſhed, hath its place in the whole work, juſtification and remiſſion of ſins, muſt be by the blood of Chriſt; reconciliation and peace muſt be through his blood, purging of the conſcience muſt be by blood, redemption muſt be by his blood, Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Purchaſe of the Kingdom, all by blood; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called the blood <hi>of the everlaſting covenant, Heb.</hi> 13. 20. And by the ſhedding of his blood hath he eſtabliſhed this covenant.</p>
                  <p>Oh, learn hence to prize Chriſt crucified more; have a high eſteem of the blood of Chriſt, and tremble in the thoughts of ſuch horrid principles as tend to the <hi>trampling under foot the blood of the covenant, counting ing it an unholy thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>6th.</hi> To proceed to the reaſons or grounds why Chriſt hath taken away the firſt, and eſtabliſhed the ſecond covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. That the Scripture might be fullfilled, the many Promiſes of God in Scripture to this purpoſe to eſtabliſh the <hi>new,</hi> and make the firſt <hi>old,</hi> as hath been already proved. And this you will find to be the great end of Jeſus Chriſt in his coming, and work to fulfil Scripture. So this covenant muſt be eſtabliſhed by blood to fulfil Scripture, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 11. See <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19, 21. The covenant made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his ſeed all nations ſhould be bleſſed, could not have been
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170388:37"/> fulfilled if Chriſt had not eſtabliſhed it. Hence it is that Chriſt ſuffered himſelf to be betrayed and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in order to his paſſion, and would not make reſiſtance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 52, 53, 54. <hi>How then ſhall the Scripture be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be?</hi> He makes the fulfilling of the Scriptures the ground of his yielding himſelf into the hands of ſinful men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Chriſt hath done this, that ſo Gods ſpecial love might be made manifeſt unto the ſons of men, and that his grace, even the bleſſing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel might come forth to us Gentiles, through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of this covenant, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations be bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh then let not us Gentiles argue out this covenant, for aſſuredly there is no bleſſing to the Nations by that of the Law, but by this of grace, therefore let us learn to prize this ſpecial grace of this everlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Gods ſpecial and everlaſting love in his dear Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. That ſalvation might be ſure to all the ſeed, therefore muſt this ſure and unchangeable cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be eſtabliſhed; for eternal ſalvation was not ſure to any in the old covenant, but in this covenant it is ſure. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore it is that this covenant is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the ſure mercies of</hi> David, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. This is the onely ſure covenant, here is grace and the truth of grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 17. The Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. Becauſe it was the great deſign of God ſo to do, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſending of Jeſus Chriſt into the world to effect this work, the taking away of the old, and eſtabliſhing of the new covenant: If this had not been done there had been nothing in order to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of Gods deſign in the great and good work of ſalvation done. The deſign of God in ſending Chriſt, was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170388:37"/> that men through him might be ſaved, he came into <hi>the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> and there could be no ſalvation but in this covenant; ſo that had not Chriſt done this work he had not been the Chriſt; for he muſt anſwer Gods deſign, for he came to do his wil. And this was one great part of his will, the eſtabliſhing of this free, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, holy, rich, and everlaſting covenant of grace and glory.</p>

                  <head>I come now to Application.</head>
                  <p>I ſhall paſs by that of information: let the doctrine and proof thereof ſerve for information of the judgement in this matter: But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Here it is a ſtrong ground of conſolation for all true believers. Jeſus Chriſt hath taken away the firſt the old, and eſtabliſhed the ſecond, the new covenant of grace and peace.</p>
                  <p>Here lyeth the grace, the love, the peace, the glory, all bleſſedneſs in this covenant, <hi>and it is ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> and God hath made it to the end it might be <hi>ſure,</hi> that the <hi>comers thereunto might have ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi> Heb. 16, 17, 18. This is a covenant in which it is <hi>impoſſible for God to lie:</hi> He hath covenanted and ſworn to it, that we might <hi>have ſtrong conſolation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Oh therefore my beloved friends, you I mean that are intereſted in this ſure everlaſting covenant, let it be your work to be much in the meditation and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the grace, the love, the glory of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. All true believers may truly ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 31. <hi>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</hi> Not of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from <hi>Mount Sinai which gendreth to bondage,</hi> but of the covenant from <hi>Mount Sion which is free, which is the mother of us all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let it be therefore your work, by faith, and hope, and meditation about the grace and glory of this covenant,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170388:38"/> to ſuck the ſweetneſs, and feed on the marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is freely from the father given to you in Jeſus. I am perſwaded, nay, I am very much aſſured, that the Lords poor people very often go without the comfort of the Covenant of the grace of the Goſpel, for want of feeding their ſouls thereon; there is <hi>bread enough in the fathers houſe,</hi> but there wants a will, or skill to feed thereon. Either want of ſight of its worth, or an appetite to it, or elſe a ſuppoſition of unfitneſs, and unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, occaſions many a ſoul truly intereſted in the grace of the Covenant, to lye ſhort of a right improvement of their intereſt there, and ſo loſe the comfort and ſweetneſs they might otherwiſe enjoy.</p>
                  <p>Here is a ground for, and matter of conſolation in all conditions, and under all temptations, be it ſins and infirmities, there is grace in the covenant to pardon. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be ſence of weakneſs, and fear of holding out to the end, here is all the Attributes of God himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for thy ſupport, the Promiſe is in Chriſt, thou ſhalt be bleſſed. See the great and Precious Promiſes of the new covenant, to this purpoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>Iſay</hi> 40. 28, 29, 31. &amp; 41. 10. &amp; 43. 1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 5.

                  <p>
                     <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified together with him.</hi> Rom. 8. 17. <hi>For thoſe light afflictions which are but for a moment, will work for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory, while we look not at things that are ſeen but at things that are not ſeen, &amp;c.</hi> And that your ſouls may live upon the goodneſs of God in this covenant of grace, let it be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170388:38"/> your care to make much of the Scripture, in which the Covenant is ſtated and held forth. And acquaint your ſelves with the Promiſes of the covenant, which are all but branches thereof, and they are ſuitable to all eſtates, and will afford aſſured comfort to thy ſoul if rightly and ſutably applied. And in the Promiſes of the Covenant, if ſaith be rightly ſet on work, thou wilt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all the Attributes of God for thy comfort, goodneſs and love in engaging himſelf, and intereſting thee in ſuch a Covenant, Power, wiſdom, faithfulneſs and juſtice in performing. Oh here is a ſtable a ſure Covenant. Saints may draw ſtable and ſure conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their own ſouls herein; yet notwithſtanding they may ſay with <hi>David, although my houſe be not ſo with God yet he hath made with me a ſure Covenant.</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 5. although I am weak and frail and <hi>in my fleſh dwelletb no good thing,</hi> and I have cauſe to loath my ſelf in mine own eyes, yet God hath made with me, (or rather with Chriſt for me) a ſure Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay, here is ground of ſtrong conſolation indeed, for thoſe that are intereſted in it, and have a right unto it, but how may I know that I have a right to this covenant, that I may improve it to my comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Notwithſtanding that God and Chriſt hath an intereſt in perſons and that by virtue of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, before they believe, yet <hi>we</hi> cannot claim any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or right before and without faith. Therefore we may truly ſay as the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 11. By this I know thou favoureſt me, becauſe mine enemies tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph not over me. So I ſay, we come to know our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the incovenant by the work he hath wrought in us, therefore hath the Lord wrought the work of faith, and hope in God through Jeſus Chriſt, and this attended with ſelf loathing, and a ſence of ſpiritual poverty, and adhering to, and depending upon the rich grace of God in Chriſt crucified, and this attended with a true
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170388:39"/> deſire and endevour of living to God and anſwering of his goodneſs. I ſay, if this law of God be thus written by the Spirit in your hearts, you may comfortably conclude your intereſt in the covenant. For I ſay, you muſt come to conclude your intereſt in the covenant, from the work of the Spirit in you, that anſwers the terms of the Covenant, and holds harmony to what God hath promiſed in the covenant. I ſay not, that this work within, is the ground of our being in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor the cauſe, nor the ground of our faith, but a demonſtration of our intereſt there, all is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the free and everlaſting love of God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. But I ſhall proceed to a ſecond word of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Saints intereſted in this covenant. And that is a word of exhortation, to be faithful to God in living the life of the new covenant, and performing the duties thereof: not onely to rejoyce in the ſweetneſs and comfort of the covenant, but likewiſe to be as willing to be found faithful in performing the duties of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for we are to know that God hath annexed duties to the covenant, and doth as poſitively require and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the performance thereof, in the life of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as he hath and doth work his people into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city thereof.</p>
                  <p>Therefore remember this, that Gods goodneſs and abſoluteneſs in the covenant, no whit diminiſheth the Saints duty, but rather ſupporteth and engageth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. In this place, I ſhall not come to ſtate the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular duties, but refer it till afterwards, onely ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heads in which all particulars are included.</p>
                  <p>1 Then to live the life of the covenant, is to live the life <hi>of faith, and hope in God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 21. Heb. 10 38. <hi>now the juſt ſhall live by faith, &amp;c.</hi> now, that is on this ſide the poſſeſſion of the kingdom, and the glory. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> that is, in the Promiſes of God that relate to the kingdom, and in the power, ſtrength and faithfulneſs of God in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170388:39"/> of his grace, by which his people are preſerved and kept untill that day. 1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> note, that the Saints are kept by the <hi>Power of God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> but <hi>it is through faith,</hi> that is, through their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by faith in his faithful word. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to every one that believeth.</hi> The Goſpel is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made ſure and effecting its work, but it is through faith. As God by it works faith, ſo he ſupporteth and powerfully effecteth the work of ſalvation by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, imploying or working of the ſame faith, for faith is of a working nature, <hi>it worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. Therefore as it is your duty, ſo let it be your work to live by faith, and remember that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Take heed brethren leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.</hi> And that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not high minded but fear.</hi> Remember <hi>thy</hi> duty as well as <hi>Gods</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and be <hi>faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond new Covenant duty, is to live the life of love, and that to God, to his name, to his word, to his ordinances: to his people, and to all men, enemies as well as friends, this is the duty of the new Covenant. And this faith and love where it is in truth, worketh over the ſoul to a univerſal obedience, to the whole will of Chriſt in the new covenant, it ſaith <hi>Amen</hi> to eve y part thereof, it dares not entertain thoughts of taking one part and leave another, no, that is carnal, and too low for a new covenant ſpirited Chriſtian. It dares not change the ordinances of the everlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; no, nor trample the blood thereof underfoot. But I forbear in this place becauſe you will finde a more exact ſtating of the duties of the covenant in the end of this Treatiſe, to which I refer you.</p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:170388:40"/>
                  <p> I ſhall cloſe up the point in hand in anſwering two weighty Queries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 1. What ſhould be the Cauſes or Reaſons that God ſhould adde a conditional miniſtry, and ſeveral conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Promiſes, with poſitive duties to an abſolute Covenant?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That therein he might hold forth, as in the one the riches of his grace, and abſoluteneſs of his purpoſe, concerning the ſalvation of his people, ſo in the other he keeps up his authority as a father, and the authority of Chriſt as our Lord and king. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the new covenant on Gods part be abſolute, yet had he not ſtated conditions on mans part, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over his people muſt have fallen, and they left without duty to God as a Father, or to Chriſt as their Lord and King, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22, 23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 46. Therefore it is conditional as to them, that they might know their duty, and have conſcience of it. And it is abſolute on Gods part, that ſo they might look to him, and be comforted, and live by faith, in the ſtabillity and unchangeableneſs that is in the Father and the Son. So that by this means the Saints are kept clear and conſcientious of and to their duties in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and comforted in looking up to the Lord from whence their ſtrength comes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe perſons muſt be judged by the duties of the Covenant on mans part and condemned too: for tranſgreſſion of the conditions, and duties of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The abſoluteneſs of Gods covenant ſhall not be the rule of judging. Though that be the ground of all true happineſs to the Saints, yet the Saints themſelves muſt be judged in the great day of the Lord, and the conditions and duties of the Covenant ſhall be the rule by which they ſhall be judged. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35, 36. we muſt not onely <hi>all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement ſeat, there to give an account:</hi> but we muſt expect to give an account, <hi>according to the</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:170388:40"/> 
                     <hi>things done in the body, &amp;c.</hi> and the Lords own people (many of them) are like to have ſuch an account to give, as in which they may &amp; muſt ſuffer loſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14, 15. and the eternal judgement of the wicked will be for the tranſgreſſion of the rules, conditions and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the covenant. I mean ſuch as have come under the ſound of the doctrine of the covenant, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. So that by this means <hi>all the world ſhall ſtand guilty before God at that day.</hi> Sutable to the preaching forth of the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Whether in the works of creation, and the daily good the world enjoys upon that account, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of God through the law, or in the plain miniſtration of the Goſpel. And true believers ſhall then be acquitted, and eternally pardoned by the grace of the covenant, for then ſhall be the perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat adminiſtration of the grace of the covenant, and in this manner, and at this time, it ſhall make the comers thereunto perfect, <hi>Iſay</hi> 33. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. Then, <hi>the inhabitant ſhall not ſay I am ſick,</hi> for the <hi>People that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 That the Saints being juſtified and eternally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the grace of the covenant might have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the kingdom promiſed diſpenſed to them ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their faithfulneſs in the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and duties of the covenant, <hi>for thus it ſhall be.</hi> Let none through ignorance account it Popiſh, but keep clear in this, That juſtification and a ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is clear by the blood of the covenant, our intereſt; and claimed by faith and hope, which faith, if true, is <hi>the faith of the operation,</hi> of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. (That is) of the work of God, but the reward ſo much ſpoken of ſhall be given ſutable to the work, either active in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Paſſive in ſuffering, elſe what means thoſe Scriptures <hi>Luke</hi> 19 17, 18, 19. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17, 18, 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. and the condemnation of the wicked ſhall be given to them, ſutable to the nature of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170388:41"/> their ſin againſt Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47, 48.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath God ſtated conditions, and duties in an abſolute covenant, that his own name and honour as a Father, and Chriſts authority, as a head and Lord might be preſerved, that he might be juſt, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when he judgeth and condemneth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the perſons who through faith come to profeſs an intereſt in this covenant might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by their performance of the duties of the covenant. The truth of faith in Chriſt, and love to him, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by obedience to him, and the people that have no heart to the <hi>duties</hi> of the covenant may juſtly ſuſpect themſelves to have no ſhare in the grace in that Covenant <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>If you love me keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>He that loveth me not keepeth not my ſayings, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 That believers might be kept humble and heedful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not high minded but fear.</hi> Ver. 21. Take heed leſt he ſpare not thee. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Let us therefore fear leſt a promiſe being left us of entering into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> God would that his peoples <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>watchfulneſs,</hi> ſhould go hand in hand, till they are fully poſſeſt of the promiſed reſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, rejoyce with trembling.</hi> Saints muſt rejoyce, and yet tremble, believe and yet be watchful, and therefore the abſolute Covenant hath conditions annext to it, in the miniſtration of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 And finally, that there might be a Probable and righteous means of calling out and ſeparating the elect from among others, <hi>they being by nature children of wrath even as others,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3. <hi>Of the ſame lump,</hi> Rom. 9 21. Chriſt comes with a general and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal miniſtry, works effectually with it, and by it, on the elect, and leaves others to the miniſtry, who one way, or other, firſt or laſt, fall ſhort of anſwering the terms and conditions of the miniſtry, and ſo obtain
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170388:41"/> not the mercy promiſed in the covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>The election obtains, and the reſt are blinded,</hi> Rom. 11. 7. and this conditional miniſtry added to the abſolute covenant, becomes <hi>unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt both in them that are ſaved and in them that periſh, to the one the ſavour of death unto death, and to the other the ſavour of life unto life, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 15, 16. Hence it is that <hi>the Goſpel muſt be preached to every creature, yet the believer onely is ſaved by it, and the unbeliever damned,</hi> Mark 16. 15, 16. And the Perſons for whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered affliction in the fulfilling of his miniſtry were the elect, <hi>That they might obtain the ſalvation which is in Chriſt Jeſus with eternal glory.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 10. He ſerved Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and end in Preaching the Goſpel every where, <hi>teſtifying to Jew and Gentile, repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Act. 20. 21. which firſt and chiefly was the converſion and conſolation of the elect in order to their obtaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the day of Chriſt with eternal glory. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a conditional miniſtry is added to an abſolute co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that the elect might be called out of the world to partake of the grace and glory of the covenant. Thus much to the firſt Quaerie, the ſecond follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. If the caſe be ſo, What are the means by which the Lord exerciſeth his Power in carrying on his work in his People, engaging their hearts to the duties of the covenant?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides a ſanctified uſe of the holy Scriptures, which it concerns the Saints to improve, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. a faithful uſe of all his ordinances and conſtant way of obedience, for in this will the Lord be found, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay beſide theſe things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 A true ſence of the duty, and this it concerns the Lords People to have upon their hearts daily, and in all their divine ſervices to perform them as duty to their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170388:42"/> Lord. This is it will put an end to indifferency in the work, &amp; keep up the authority of Chriſt. Its no wonder if perſons grow empty in duty, and the Lord leaves them, if they do it but as priviledge only, and not alſo as duty. I do believe much might be enjoyed of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved from him, if there were more conſcience of duty to him. Doubtleſs if a ſon would ſubmit to his father onely upon the account of Priviledge and liberty, and not of duty, and own this as his principle, he would juſtly deſerve frowning and reproof from his father. And in this caſe would doubtleſs be often found in neglect of duty. Whence is it that profeſſing men and women, can ſo eaſily and ordinarily ſlip by, and paſs over duties, but becauſe they ſuppoſe it not to be duty, but liberty, and at beſt, and moſt, but priviledge? My friends, I deſire you ſeriouſly to lay this to heart, and conſider theſe Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. <hi>So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done all theſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſay we are unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> Joh. 15. 14. Acts 3. 22, 23. 1 Cor. 14. 37.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Love is that which carrieth to duty. The love of Chriſt begets love in the hearts of Chriſtians to Chriſt, and this enlargeth the heart to ſerve, this is the oyl that makes the wheel to run pleaſantly. Where <hi>the love of Chriſt is ſhed abroad in the heart by the holy ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. it conſtraineth ſouls to a willing and chearful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and performance of duty. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, &amp;c.</hi> Love where it is in truth is of a conſtraining nature, and that is it, Chriſt ſo often ſpeaks to this purpoſe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>If ye love me keep my commandements,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>he that hath my commandements, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>If any man love me he will keep my ſayings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>He that loveth me not keepeth not my ſayings, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 The glory of the great and good name of God is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170388:42"/> another means by which his people ſhould be, and are carried on in a way of well doing, that their fathers name may be glorified. Oh, friends, it concerns the children of God, to have a tender reſpect to his name, and to ſay as ſometimes, <hi>Joſhua</hi> in another caſe. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>And what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</hi> So let the Saints reaſon with themſelves, ſhall I walk like the world? ſhall I neglect duty, or turne aſide from the truth? what will become of the great name of God then? The <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and enemies of truth will hear of it, and reproach the great name of God, Oh, think on this friends, and remember that this was it that kept thoſe in an evil time, when others ſaid <hi>it was in vain to ſerve God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>They that feared God and thought upon his name,</hi> were preſerved in that Apoſtacy, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. and God will think on them in the needful day. See <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. And this is the prayer of the Apoſtle for the Church. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11, 12. <hi>Wherefore alſo we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleaſure of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the work of faith with power, that the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be glorified in you, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 The good of poor ſinners, that is another thing the Lord would have his people to be laying to heart, and to know that profeſſing people by evil works do what in them lyeth to keep ſouls from Chriſt. Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of profeſſing people, through the devils improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, becomes ſtumbling blocks to poor ſinners to harden them: but a good converſation tends to win them, or it may through the Lords bleſſing work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it. We may ſay truly in this matter as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, and to the believing wife and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>its the will of God that, at leaſt, his people ſhould by well doing put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 15.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The great and precious Promiſes is another way, by which the Lord carrieth his on in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170388:43"/> performance of the duties of the covenant, and theſe Promiſes are of three ſorts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Of Acceptance.</item>
                     <item>2 Of Aſſiſtance.</item>
                     <item>3 Of Reward.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1 Of acceptance in the work, being well pleaſed with his people, in their obedience to him, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of grace received from him, being made, accepted in the beloved, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 40. 41. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Of aſſiſtance in the work. When the Saints are faithful in their duty to the Lord, he will be with them to aſſiſt them (1) in their active ſervice in doing, <hi>Iſay</hi> 40. 29, 31. with <hi>Phil</hi> 4. 13. Therefore let us commit the keeping of our ſouls to him in well doing as to a faithful creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. (z) in their paſſive ſervice in ſuffering, <hi>Iſay</hi> 41. 10. &amp; 43. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Of reward, Promiſes of life and ſalvation, thus we ſhall finde the Saints helpt along in all ages. <hi>They had reſpect to the recompence of reward, Heb.</hi> 11. 13. 14, 16, 26. and doubtleſs the Lord hath not promiſed it, but to the end his people might be comforted in it, and incouraged in their duties to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32, 33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2. Although this be not the firſt moving cauſe of duty of God, but conſcience of the duty, and the life and love we receive from him, yet it is the duty of Chriſtians to have this upon their hearts, elſe they cannot glorifie God in the riches of his glory, as well as his grace. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth and laſt, I ſhall at preſent minde is afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and judgement, and this is clear. God will afflict his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. from 5 to 10 verſe, and <hi>judge them</hi> too, that they may not <hi>be condemned with the world.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 30, 31, 32. God dealeth with his children as a father, if love will not do it, then the rod muſt. So dealeth the Lord with his children, and that not onely here but in the great day of accounts they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170388:43"/> muſt be judged according to their works, and it may be ſuffer blame, ſhame and loſs too, at that great day of the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15. Therefore let the Lords people be exerciſing themſelves in theſe things, and they ſhall finde them to be of ſingular uſe to help them forward in their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an race, and to enlarge their hearts and ſtrengthen their hands in the Lords work, ſutable to his will in the new covenant of his grace.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall at preſent proceed no further in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but come to ſpeak ſomething more diſtinct, to the Mediatorſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Mediator of the New Covenant. A truth it is, of great and ſpecial concernment, for the Saints to be acquainted with, that they may be exerciſing their faith therein, and thereby be drawing ſuch ſutable conſolation to their ſouls there from, as God hath intended in it, and as doth concern them to their comfortable walking with God.</p>

               <p>HAving gone through the ſtating and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the firſt and ſecond covenants, and the eſtabliſhing of the ſecond, the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and doing away the old,</p>

               </p>
               <p>The apoſtle or author of this Epiſtle, as his work is to exalt Chriſt and the new covenant above <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that of the <hi>old,</hi> as hath been already mentioned. So in this chapter, eſpecially from verſe 18. to the end of the 24. he preſents both the Hebrews (to whom he wrote) and us, with the excellency of what believers are come to in the new covenant, beyond what they were come to in the old, and ſo the excellent ſtate of believers in the new covenant, above what it was in the old. And this is ſtated in two particulars.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170388:44"/> to 22. wherein one great part of the bleſſing of the Goſpel conſiſts, that we are not come to that which the people in the old covenant came to in that covenant, (to wit) in the miniſtry thereof, although that was <hi>glorious,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Affirmatively, what they are come to, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24. wherein another great part of the Goſpel conſiſts.

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. What a Mediator is. The word Mediator ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a middle perſon, or one between. Its taken from an Umpire or middle perſon that is choſen between two at difference, to make up the breach between them. And this is it I underſtand <hi>Job</hi> intends in his complaint, <hi>Job.</hi> 9. 33. <hi>Neither is there any dayes-man, or Umpire betwixt us that might lay his hands upon us both.</hi> Under his affliction he ſaw the want of ſuch a one, between God and him, and doubtleſs he relates to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low in his faith in this matter, under his preſſing affliction. But now Jeſus Chriſt is the dayes-man, the middle perſon, that is come between God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is the ſecond particular propoſed (namely)</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove that Jeſus Chriſt is the middle perſon between God and man, or the Mediator of the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for proof, ſee not onely the text which is full and clear, but likewiſe <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 6. he is ſaid to be <hi>the Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> (that is) of the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which is <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament. &amp;c.</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>There is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Thus you ſee the truth lieth clear; That Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediator of the new covenant, a truth of very great and ſpecial concernment for the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170388:45"/> Lords people to be acquainted with and eſtabliſhed in: it being the enemies deſign and great endeavour to ruine faith in this truth, and hath gon very far in the work with many at this day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The perſons for whom he is a Mediator, and the matter for what, and that not onely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Generally for men. <hi>There is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, and more particularly, and eſpecially, he is a Mediator of the new covenant: ſo that then he is a Mediator for thoſe included in the covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I have before ſhewed that the covenant is made with Chriſt, and in him, with, and for all the elect, and choſen of the Father, ſo that he mediates,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For, and in behalf of thoſe given to him by the Father, in order to the work of converſion, and coming in to own the grace of the covenant. My beloved friends, I do believe, that there is never a ſinner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the evil of his way: but it is by vertue of the Mediatorſhip of Jeſus Chriſt at the right hand of God. <hi>John.</hi> 3. 3. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Except a man be born from above he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> So the word in the Greek, <hi>(from above)</hi> and <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.</hi> And truly the work of converſion and faith in Jeſus is a good work. Therefore its added <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.</hi> It is ſuch a gift as he that hath it not muſt be damned it is a fruit of the ſpirit, <hi>that is the earneſt of our i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eritance, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> I ſuppoſe that none of knowledge and conſcience dare deny but that all good is by vertue of Chriſt. God gives it by him, and that in way of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip.</p>
               <p>Its true, ſome there are who are ſo bold as to deny
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170388:46"/> faith and converſion to be the gift of God, that they would have to be beaten out of their own brains. But as it is a gift from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaven, ſo it is by vertue of Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. To deny this is to deny ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt: for if ſaith and ſalvation be not by vertue of Chriſt his Mediatorſhip with the Father, then ſalvation may be obtained without a Mediator, and this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſtroys the Goſpel and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. But the new birth is a heavenly birth <hi>(that is)</hi> a birth from above. Hence it is the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. <hi>Jeruſalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all:</hi> and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 87. ſpeaking prophetically of the new covenant, and of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that City which is above, and the flowing in of the Gentiles, ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Of Zion it ſhall be ſaid, This and that man was born in her</hi> (that is) <hi>Jeruſalem which is above:</hi> from thence is the work wrought, thence is the ſpirit given. <hi>If I go away</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will ſend the ſpirit and he wil convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgement, John</hi> 16. 7, 8. Its the ſpirits work to convince of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (that is) to effect by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, the whole work of converſion. And the ſending of the ſpirit is a fruit of Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip. <hi>If I go not away the comforter will not come: but if I go away I will ſend him,</hi> and <hi>I will pray the Father, and he will ſend you another comforter, &amp;c.</hi> The Mediatorſhip of Chriſt, and the doctrine of the Goſpel concurs together, and the ſpirit, that is a fruit of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, as well as the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and is given to converſion, in the preaching of the doctrine of the Goſpel. <hi>This I would learn of you, received ye the ſpirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Gal.</hi> 3. 2. So that it is evident that Jeſus Chriſt is a Mediator of the new covenant in behalf of unconverted ones, for their converſion and work of faith, that they might come to know the grace given to them in Chriſt, and ſo come to receive the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170388:46"/> grace prepared for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. Then ſaid Jeſus, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 He is a Mediator for all his people, believers to whom the covenant is revealed, or made known, he is with the Father for them. He is between God and man, <hi>viz.</hi> His people. That is it the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>He is now in the preſence of God for us,</hi> (that is) for his people, believers, if they <hi>ſin</hi> he is their <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Advocate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what doth he mediate for, for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In brief, he is all to his Father for his people, and brings down all good from the Father to his people: he makes both the perſons and ſervices of his people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with the Father, and makes the Fathers good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will, acceptable to and with his people. This is the ſum of all, from whence every branch flows.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, as he mediates to the Father for his people, ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He preſents their perſons and makes them accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though they are poor and wretched in themſelves, yet, to the Father they are lovely in his ſon; a word of ſingular conſolation for poor Saints, who live in the ſight and ſence of their own poverty. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>And lo, a voyce from heaven, ſaying, This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſon in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> God is not onely well pleaſed with Chriſt, but he is well pleaſed in him with all his poor people, and that is it Chriſt ſaith, Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3. Jeſus Chriſt is a Mediator for ſuch, and they are <hi>made accepted in the beloved.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 6.</p>
               <p>Thus through the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt the perſons of his people are accepted of the Father, and ſo they ſtand in an acceptable juſtified ſtate with God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:170388:47"/> 2 Their ſervices are by virtue of the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt accepted with God: he is not onely well pleaſed with their perſons, but he is likewiſe well pleaſed with their ſervices, their obedience in every duty done in faith according to his will, and their Praiſes and Prayers, that is made acceptable with the Father by Jeſus Chriſt. He it is <hi>that bears the iniquity of their holy things,</hi> obtaining the pardon of all their defects, 1 <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> 1. 9. with <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 1, 2. He <hi>mixes much incenſe with their prayers.</hi> or adds it to their Prayers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4. even the incenſe of the precious worth of his death and ſuffering, being offered up in his Mediatorſhip a <hi>ſweet ſmelling favour to God,</hi> Eph. 5. 2. Thus the ſervices of the Saints are preſented to God acceptable by Jeſus. Oh, then let the Saints learn to know where &amp; in whom their acceptation is not in themſelves but in another, even in Jeſus Chriſt who is with the Father for them.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, Chriſt doth not onely make the ſervices of Saints acceptable, but he himſelf who knows their wants better then they, preſents their wants for them, which I ſhall more diſtinctly ſpeak unto, when I come to ſhew you the manner how he mediates for his People:</p>
               <p>And as he is all to the father for his people ſo,</p>
               <p n="2">2 He is all from the Father to his people (that is) He mediates for, and brings down all from the Father to his people.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He mediates for the ſpirit: and the holy Spirit is the fruit of Chriſts mediatorſhip, a ſpecial word to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to the right way of obtaining a greater meaſure of the ſpirit of promiſe, it muſt be by virtue of the mediatorſhip of Chriſt, if ever we have it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father and he will give you another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, even the ſpirit of truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the comforter, the holy Spirit whom the Father will ſend in my name,</hi> &amp;c. Mark you friends, <hi>the Father will ſend the holy Spirit the comforter in the name of Chriſt,</hi> in his authority, by virtue of his mediatorſhip <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 7. if I go not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170388:47"/> away, the comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you. You heard <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>The Father will ſend the holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 26. He is ſaid; <hi>to proceed from the Father,</hi> but here Chriſt will ſend the Spirit, and what doth this teach us, but firſt, the unity of the Father and Son, in the work of ſending the holy Spirit? The Father the head and fountain from whence he proceeds and is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally ſent, the Son in way of mediatorſhip by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of office, and ſo both Father and Son ſends the Spirit. So likewiſe its the ſame, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, When he aſcended up on high he laid captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. He aſcended up on high, that he might do it,</hi> (that is) by virtue of his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip. So that Jeſus Chriſt brings down the holy Spirit to his people.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He mediates for, and brings down peace to his people from the God of peace, that ſo he may perform his legacy and promiſe when he went away <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you that in me you might have peace,</hi> &amp;c. And this he doth by ſending down the Spirit of Peace, working in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Peace. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Grace to you and Peace from God our Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Peace comes from God and Chriſt, from God as the Father and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Peace, from Chriſt the mediator for peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He mediates and brings down comfort and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for and to his people, according to his Promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs,</hi> &amp;c. and the way by which he comforts his People is by <hi>ſending the comforter the holy Spirit,</hi> (a fruit of his mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) to lead them into truth, and apply it to them for their comfort.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He mediates and brings down the grace of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for and to his people. It is the work of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by degrees to work a through ſanctification in his
<pb facs="tcp:170388:48"/> people, that they may be holy in body and in ſpirit, and meet to Poſſeſs their holy inheritance. Hence is that prayer of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>And the very God of Peace ſanctifie you wholly, &amp;c.</hi> Now Chriſt prays that his Father would do it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 15, 16, 17. <hi>I pray that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the evil</hi> of the world. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> So that the Lords peoples ſanctification, and univerſal conformity to his minde and will, is a bleſſed fruit and effect of the Mediatory office of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5 He mediates for, and brings down the power and ſtrength of, upholding and perſevering grace, of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming duty of overcoming ſin and temptations, of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the Lords way, and holding out unto the end, notwithſtanding afflictions, tribulations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions that Saints meet with becauſe of the word. The Lord Jeſus mediates for the ſtrength of grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>and now I come to thee, Holy Father, keep through thine own name thoſe that thou haſt given me,</hi> v. 15. Luke 22. 31. 32. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, Satan bath deſired to have you, that he might ſift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi> Oh friends, look to God for ſupporting, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſupplying and renewing grace to be given down unto you through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt: its by him your ſtrength is renewed, continued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereby you <hi>run and are not weary,</hi> walk <hi>and are not</hi> faint.</p>
               <p n="6">6 He mediates for, and brings down the anſwers of all the Saints Prayers, and a ſupply of all their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> Chriſt will do it, that the Father may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Son, <hi>viz.</hi> the father will glorifie himſelf, in and by the ſon, in giving anſwers to his people by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>that whatſoever ye ask the Father in my name he may give it you,</hi> and 16. 23. <hi>Verily, verily,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:170388:48"/> 
                  <hi>I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</hi> Phil. 4. 19. <hi>But my God ſhall ſupply all your needs according to his riches in glory by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Mark freinds, God will ſupply the needs of his People, but it muſt be by Jeſus Chriſt as he is the Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And finally not to multiply any more particulars of this nature in this place, Jeſus Chriſt mediates for, and brings down to his people all the bleſſings of the New Covenant, of which he is the Mediator, for on that account it is that he is the Mediator of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for the bringing down all the bleſſings of grace and glory that are contained in the Covenant, and that is as hath been before proved, all things which may tend to make them truely and eternally bleſſed, juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſanctifying, preſerving, comforting, and glorifying grace. <hi>Grace and glory, and no good thing will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held</hi> from his People.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I come now to the fourth particular propoſed (to wit) the place where Jeſus Chriſt mediates for his people, and that is in heaven, whither he aſcended when he was taken up, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 10, 11. A truth of ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for Saints to be eſtabliſhed in, for loſe the place, and loſe the perſon and work, and all at once. A great cheat of the adverſary at this day that perſwades poor People of ſuch a heaven and Chriſt within them, as to deny and gain-ſay Chriſt and heaven above, and pretend a ſuppoſition, that if Chriſt be perſonally in heaven, and by his Spirit in his people, it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily make two Chriſts.</p>
               <p>But this is a truth, and it concerns all true believers that expect ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, to believe and know, That (according to the Scriptures) Jeſus Chriſt is in heaven, at the right hand of God in the work of mediatorſhip, <hi>Angels and Principalities, and Powers, being made ſubject to him.</hi> 1 Pet. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </list>
               <p n="1">1 Chriſt mediates with his bloud as he was a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for when he was on earth, he offered up himſelf a ſacrifice for the ſin of ſinners. He then performed the Prieſtly work in offering himſelf, but having offered up himſelf a ſacrifice, he is gone into heaven and makes good that ſacrifice there. The high Prieſt was a type of this <hi>in entring into the holy place, and that not</hi> without bloud. <hi>Christ is entred with his own bloud into heaven</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170388:49"/> 
                  <hi>it ſelf, there to appear in the preſence of God for us, Heb.</hi> 9. 23. 24. And by his blood he mediates; that is clear by the words immediately following my Text. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. <hi>And to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling that ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel.</hi> The blood of Chriſt pleads for the Lords people, it was ſhed for them, and therefore it pleads for them <hi>better things then that of Abel. Abels</hi> blood cried for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeance, but the blood of Chriſt crieth for mercy for poor ſinners, for the giving down the good things of the Covenant, for which it was ſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He mediates vocally in behalf of his people. He prayes for them as a ſon, as a high prieſt, that is the ſon of God conſecrated for evermore. And that Chriſt doth ſo, will appear.</p>

               <p n="1">1. From Scripture: the words of Chriſt are full and plain in this matter. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. <hi>I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and he ſhall give you another comforter. &amp;c.</hi> Here is Chriſts promiſe at his departure, <hi>that he will pray &amp;c.</hi> And this is further clear, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 7. If I go not away the comforter will not come, but if I go I will ſend him <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (that is) <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall ſend him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 26. And I ſay not unto you that I will pray the Father for you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by this it ſeems that Chriſt will not pray vocally for his people in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This being rightly underſtood, no whit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the truth in hand, or the former promiſe of Chriſt, that he would pray the Father for his people when he came to heaven: but rather confirms the truth thereof, it being uſual in the holy Scriptures that when any thing of ſpecial concernment follows; that which goes before is expreſt with a not, not to deny the thing, but to confirm the truth and excellency of that, which in that ſaying is moſt eſpecially intended, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170388:50"/> yet that which is brought in with a not, is as fully true as the other.</p>
               <p>Inſtances are, <hi>John</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that meat which endureth to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> Doth Chriſt in this place forbid labour for the meat which periſheth; no doubtleſs, for it was given as a law afterwards, that ſuch as would not work ſhould not eat, and idleneſs is forbidden in all, therefore that we are to underſtand is, Labor not onely or chiefly for the meat which periſheth? So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>I was not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel</hi> (that is) not onely or chief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly ſent to baptize. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the tranſgreſſion.</hi> Was not <hi>Adam</hi> deceived? yea, doubtleſs, and in other places it is laid all upon him, death came in by him, but <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, not alone, nor was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, now the Apoſtle ſpeaks of women, and applieth the womans ſin to women, and ſaith <hi>Adam was not deceived.</hi> Women ſhould know, that not onely <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, but the woman ſinned, and was firſt in the tranſgreſſion too, ſo that theſe inſtances may ſerve to clear up our underſtanding of the words of Chriſt, <hi>I ſay not that I will pray for you</hi> (that is) I ſay not onely that I will pray for you, but as a farther ground of ſtrong conſolation, <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you,</hi> by which I am ſure to prevail in what I pray for, and this is evident, for he had promiſed it before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall prove this from reaſons grounded on the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. From his praying for them when he was in this world, in ſome ſence more remote from the Father, and leſs exerciſed in the work of mediation, gives us ſtrong and undoubted grounds to believe and conclude that now he is aſcended to the Father, and is in the work of mediation, he is much more exerciſed in that work of mediating by praying for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 2. From the nearneſs of relation. and that both to the Father and the Saints, the onely Son of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170388:50"/> Father, and elder brother to the Saints. <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Go tell my brethren I aſcend to my Father and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to my God and your God.</hi> Now may we ſuppoſe that this onely ſon of God, ſo near to Saints, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to the Father in behalf of his poor people, now he is in heaven with him, that had ſo much to ſay for them when here on earth?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This appears from the various titles given to the work of Chriſt in heaven, as an Advocate (that is) one to plead for us, an interceſſor. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. Which clearly demonſtrates the truth, that Chriſt mediates in way of praying for the Saints, and on theſe grounds, I do believe it, in a meaſure with joy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is a tender and faithfull Mediator, one that the Saints may confide in, and truſt with their cauſe. Men here on earth, may and often do chooſe ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators or Umpires, that they are much in doubt of their tenderneſs, and faithfulneſs in the cauſe, but Jeſus Chriſt is both tender and faithfull to both parties in his mediation, he will not, he cannot be unfaithfull to either.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The one is his dear and Almighty Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other are his <hi>Brethren,</hi> his <hi>children, fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone, &amp;c.</hi> See both theſe (to wit) his tenderneſs and faithfulneſs, ſtated in one Scripture. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17: <hi>Wherefore in all things it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull high priest in things pertaining to God,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>cbap.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Who is faithfull to him that appointed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He is a powerfull and prevailing Mediator, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes what he mediates for, he was never denied by the Father of what he asked, nor fails in a title of all the good he undertakes to ask for his people. Hence it is Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 11. 41. 42. <hi>Father I thank thee that thou haſt heard me, and I know that thou</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:170388:51"/> 
                  <hi>heareſt me alwaies.</hi> He is called a great high-prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. Great in power, able to give what he pleads for, and therefore doubtleſs he will do it. <hi>All power in heaven and earth is given to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. and <hi>John</hi> 3. 35. <hi>The Father loveth the ſon, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> He is great in favor with God, <hi>the onely: beloved ſon of his boſom,</hi> and therefore muſt needs be a powerfull prevailing Mediator. He mediates by vertue of all his offices, King, Prieſt and prophet, and therefore muſt needs obtain what he mediates for.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He mediates, particularly and diſtinctly, for all Saints, for all wants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For all his people, he is no reſpecter of perſons, he reſpects not the rich more then the poor. The pooreſt Saints are as near and dear to him as the richeſt. He bears them all upon his heart before his Father. A bleſſed word of comfort it is for poor Chriſtians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outwardly poor or ſpiritually poor. <hi>Bleſſed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven, Luke</hi> 6. 20. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God choſen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 For the particular wants of his people. He medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates knowingly, he knows the wants of all the Saints, and all their various temptations. He knows it firſt, as it is their caſe diſtinctly, and he knows it ſecondly, by experience, and therefore mediates ſutable to their wants. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>For we have not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. He is a conſtant Mediator with the Father for his people: he doth not mediate for a time, and then have done, but he waits upon the work continually, it is his office, he is thereunto appointed by the Father. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>He is gone into heaven</hi> for that very end,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170388:51"/> 
                  <hi>now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. My friends, Jeſus Chriſt is not like unto a bad Lawyer that will plead ſuitable to his fee, and it may be when it is moſt need be away about another buſineſs, or forget his client; no, no, beloved friends although he hath undertaken the cauſe of all the Saints in the world, yet he will not forget one, nor be away while any buſineſs is paſt, for he waits on that very work: but to proceed,</p>
               <p n="6">6 The ſixth particular, is the Priviledges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that comes to the Saints by the mediatorſhip of Chriſt, and that is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Acceptance, and through it boldneſs with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Oh, my friends, believers may come with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the throne of grace. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>Having ſuch a high Prieſt let us come with boldneſs,</hi> &amp;c. God hath given by Jeſus Chriſt a liberty for a humble, holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his people. Therefore let them improve it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 An aſſured care taken for the well being of Saints. The Father hath taken care in appointing his Son to ſuch a work: Jeſus Chriſt taketh care in the performance thereof. See both theſe in <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 39. <hi>This is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould looſe nothing but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</hi> Chap. 10. 27, 28. <hi>My ſleep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life and they ſhall never periſh</hi> &amp;c. and this is accompliſhed by the mediatorſhip of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For if when we were enemies we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> Note, we ſhall be ſaved by his life (that is) by his mediatorſhip, for <hi>he ever lives to make interceſſion,</hi> and his ability to ſave is ſtated upon his ever living to make interceſſion. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Every thing that is good and beſt for them they ſhall have. Know Chriſtians, that your Father, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r Mediator, knows what is beſt for you, and that you
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170388:52"/> ſhall have aſſuredly. Oh, that Saints did all believe this, how would it tend to quiet and comfort their hearts in all eſtates? how would they learn that leſſon in all eſtates wherewith to be contented? <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 11. It is with the Lords people many times as it is with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they would fain have their own wills, when it may be ſometimes it would be to their hurt, but their Father knows beſt what is good for them, and therefore denies their will, and gives what he will. So doth the Lord, the Mediator of the new Covenant, mediate for and give that which is beſt to his people, though it may be they murmur at it through weakneſs and ignorance, it may be they deſire health and he gives ſickneſs, they deſire riches and he gives Poverty, &amp;c. why? your Lord, your Mediator knows ſickneſs to be beſt, and poverty to be beſt. Therefore be content man with what the Lord gives down. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes <hi>thrice that the thorne in the fleſh</hi> might be taken away or depart from him, &amp;c. God anſwers him in that which was beſt for him, gives him another thing for the preſent, and that is ſtrength of grace, to encounter with it, reſiſt, and bear it till it ſhould be removed. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 8, 9. And that was as good or better, then the ſudden removal of the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Advantage is the preparation of the kingdom and the glory for them. Chriſt is with his Father in heaven, not onely mediating for preſent ſupplies and ſupports, and giving a preſent acceptation to the perſons and prayers of the Saints, but he is preparing the kingdom for them, that the Father giveth to them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2. I go to prepare a place for you. Hark you, friends, Jeſus Chriſt is gone to prepare a Place for you, a heavenly, a glorious Place, <hi>an inheritance that is incorruptible and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>efiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>An houſe not made with hands but eternal in the heavens.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. and this is done
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170388:52"/> by virtue of the mediatorſhip of Chriſt, its purchaſed by virtue of his death. Hence its called <hi>the purchaſed Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 14. But it ſhall be prepared and given to them by virtue of the mediatorſhip of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7 I come to the Reaſons why the New Covenant, which is free, and abſolute, and all glorious, muſt have Chriſt to be the Mediator of it? The reaſons are,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Why it muſt be ſo.</item>
                  <item>2 Why it is ſo.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1 Why it muſt be ſo. Firſt becauſe it was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eternal councel and will, that although the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of love and all good was and is in God from all eternity, yet he never intended to bring it forth to the ſons of men any other way, but by the death and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip of Jeſus. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>He was verily foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you, who do by him believe in God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It being ſo, there is a neceſſity that Chriſt ſhould be the Mediator of this covenant, without which it is impoſſible that his people ſhould have the grace of the Covenant. This being the way ordained by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the conveyance of grace and glory to his people, and the way for his people to come up to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20. So that here is a neceſſity for Chriſt to be the Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There was and is a neceſſity in reſpect of the fallen miſerable ſtate of man by nature, and the weak poor ſtate of believers through the remainders of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, that without it there was no way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from wrath, nor of ſtanding and perſevering, nor boldneſs to come to God, but alone by and through the Mediator of the New Covenant. So that it appears here was a neceſſity for Chriſt to be the Mediator of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170388:53"/> the New Covenant (to wit) for and in behalf of his people intereſted, in the covenant, for the giving forth of the good things of the covenant unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Why it is ſo. Firſt, becauſe he was thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, and it is his office, and his work to be mediating in behalf of his People, and therefore in it Chriſt anſwers the Fathers will, and performs his office he is appointed unto.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, it is ſo, 1 becauſe Chriſt hath accepted of, and taken the office upon him, and undertaken too, for, and in the behalf of all his poor people. <hi>Loe I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> Chriſt came to undertake the office and to do the work for thoſe that could not do it themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Chriſt was appointed by the Father, and accepted of the office and work of Mediator. That ſo ſalvation might be ſure to all the ſeed, this is the way of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that God hath given to his people; that Chriſt hath undertaken he work for them, and takes the care of them. He is become their <hi>Good ſhepherd</hi> and <hi>Biſhop,</hi> (to wit) overſeer of their ſouls. He hath undertaken according to the Fathers will, to take the care of all the ſheep; and to ſee that they do not periſh, and he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to it by the very power of the Father, that he might be able to accompliſh it, it is that ſalvation might be ſure, <hi>ſure mercy, Iſay</hi> 55. 3. Sure ſupport and preſervation from enemies, that they might be ſurely and ſafely <hi>kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If Chriſt hath undertaken the work of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, (that is) the bringing forth to his people, and accompliſhing all the bleſſings of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, why then do the Saints pray for it, and endeavour after it, as if it was their work to get every bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt in my anſwer to this Queſtion ſay, as I have ſaid before touching the Covenant it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170388:53"/> That although the Covenant be abſolute, yet there is the duty of the Covenant. So I ſay, although Jeſus Chriſt be the Mediator of the New Covenant: yet it is the duty of the Lords people to ſeek after every good thing they ſtand in need of, what ever Chriſt hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to mediate for: as far as they are enlightned in it, they are to ſeek after it. And indeed it is by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the mediatorſhip of Chriſt that they have that liberty, and priviledge, and may have that boldneſs. So that Chriſt is a Mediator to procure for the Saints whatever they pray for in faith, according to the will of God, to right ends, and to procure all good for them, even what they through ignorance pray not for. The Saints prayers cannot be available but as in Chriſt their Mediator, for out of him God is <hi>a conſuming fire,</hi> but in him, and in him alone, is he full of love and grace, <hi>a God pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I come to application I ſhall ſpeak ſomething briefly unto the two other Parts or Branches of the doctrine.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Part of which is: That believers are come to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and this is a happy ſtate indeed, <hi>to come to Jeſus the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are we to underſtand by coming or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to Jeſus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To come to Jeſus is to believe in him. <hi>He that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6. 37. To come to Chriſt by faith, and to own him in all his offices, to look to him, and reſt upon him for ſalvation, to come to him, as to the Mediator of the New Covenant, to come to him as your Lord and King, to ſubmit to him in all things. To come to him ſo, as to expect all good from God by him both in reſpect of grace and glory. Thus are believers come to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170388:54"/>
               <p> The third Part or Branch is, that this is a high and glorious attainment. To be come to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of the New Covenant, is a high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attainment: it is ſo. However Satan hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over many poor ſouls of late to make them ſlight this heavenly attainment, and to trample underfoot <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus, and the blood of this Covenant,</hi> yet know friends, that you that are come to Jeſus have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a high degree of <hi>favour with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein doth the heigth of this attainment appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is high in compariſon of what they came to in the old Teſtament, and that is it which is particularly mentioned in this place, <hi>We are not come to mount Sinai,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But to mount Sion, to Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. A more bleſſed Covenant, a better Mediator, a better Prieſthood, better Promiſes, all is better in this day of grace, in this covenant of Reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Its high being compared with the ſtate of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are not come to Jeſus. They are low they muſt periſh and be damned. The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it: But he that believeth on the name of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved. <hi>There is no other name given under heaven among men, whereby they muſt be ſaved but by the name of Jeſus,</hi> Acts 4. 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is high in it ſelf. For firſt, it hath given them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n intereſt in and relation to <hi>a high God.</hi> Who ever are come to Jeſus, they are come to God as a father, and ſtand related to him as children. They are come to great and precious priviledges, and intereſted in great and precious Promiſes. They are <hi>Come to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to an innumerable company of Angels, and to God the judge of all.</hi> They are come to fellowſhip with the Father, Son, and Spirit, to fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Saints and Angels. Here is the high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeed of thoſe that are come to Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is an high Attainment in that they are come
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170388:54"/> into the way that will undoubtedly bring them to the kingdom, to the everlaſting life, glory and bleſſedneſs promiſed in the covenant, and mediated for by Jeſus Chriſt. This is the high attainment that all that are truly come to Jeſus have attained. Here is the ſtanding and ſtate of believers that are come to Jeſus: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the world thinks of them, what ever Phariſees and Hypocrites think of them, what ever the devil endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſwade them to think of themſelves, yet <hi>they are come to Jeſus.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall come to ſpeak a few words in way of application to the whole, and I ſhall have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. A word of trial whether you are indeed come to Jeſus the Mediator of the new covenant. As its a truth of very great concernment, ſo it very much concerns you to take a view of your own ſouls and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtates, whether you are come to Jeſus yea or nay. I know every one will be ready to ſay yea, I am come to Jeſus, I make no queſtion of that, when the truth is there are but few in compariſon, that are truly and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly come to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How ſhall we know, may ſome ſay, whether we are come to him or no?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe that have come to Jeſus have ſeen a need of him, and a worth in him above all the world beſides.

               <p>Oh! how few are there that are thus come to Jeſus Chriſt. Its true the world is come to him in their own fancies and imaginations, but it is but a cheat and deluſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It lieth in many things, but I ſhall at preſent mention theſe two.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Aſſured acceptation with the Father.</item>
                  <item>2. Aſſured application of pardon of ſin, and all that is good for them.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1 Aſſured acceptation with the Father, and that both in reſpect of Chriſt himſelf, and of his people in him. Here is a ground of comfort indeed for all that in truth come unto God by him. They may come with boldneſs, there is aſſured acceptance, perſons ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in him accepted, as hath been before proved: onely let the ſaints now improve it, and apply it for their comfort. Your perſons accepted though in your own eyes poor wretched creatures, your Mediator he is pure and perfect, a fit Mediator for ſuch poor impure creatures as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170388:55"/> we are. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>For ſuch an High-prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and made higher then the heavens.</hi> And here is the Chriſtians comfort, that their High-prieſt, their Mediator, is <hi>holy,</hi> and he is accepted for them into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, <hi>there to appear in the preſence of God for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Prayers granted, and whatſoever their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator ſees good ſhall be given them. Be encouraged to believe this, God will, nay he muſt keep nothing back from his people, that may be for their good, for they have a faithfull, tender, powerfull, prevalent, and holy Mediator with the Father for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein lies the prevalency of Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not onely in his near relation to the Saints, and ſo his love and faithfulneſs to them, but in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worth of his blood, that pleads prevailingly, and muſt have no denial, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5, 2. and likewiſe his near relation to him, to whom he mediates, that is his Father. He is the onely ſon, the beloved ſon, and you know how far an onely beloved ſon may prevail with his Father; and not onely ſo but he is our Father likewiſe, <hi>my Father and your Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and <hi>the Father himſelf loveth you,</hi> and therefore there is no queſtion of prevailing for every good thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is aſſured application of the pardon of ſin. Chriſts ſacrifice did purchaſe pardon, but as he liveth in heaven, a Mediator, he applieth pardon by the purchaſe. I, ſaith Chriſt, have given my life and blood for this poor ſinner, and therefore (oh, Father) let him have pardon, he ſhall have remiſſion of all his ſins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. and 2. 12. Therefore let it be your work beloved friends whoſe hearts are approaching to him, to be by faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying pardon and remiſſion to your ſelves dayly, for I know that you dayly need it, and what ever is good for you, believe, it ſhall be done, for the Father loves you,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170388:56"/> and is as willing to do for you as your Advocate is to ask, nay as you your ſelves can be to receive, therefore no doubt of receiving what is good for you.</p>
               <p>Onely here lieth the caſe: your Father and mediator ſees that to be good ſometimes which you cannot ſee to be ſo, and that makes you to diſlike, and it may be ſees that would hurt you which you are willing to have, and ſo denies you of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In a word for the improving of the conſolation of this doctrine, call to minde the former truths, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The perſons for whom he mediates.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For what he mediates.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The advantages that come thereby. And make application to your ſouls, and ſee if it fill not your hearts with all joy and peace in believing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Remember that it is a high and glorious ſtate you are come unto, above that under the law, above all hypocrites, formaliſts or notioniſts, that trample underfoot this precious ſtate. In a word above all people in the world, there is no higher eſtate attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this world, then to come to Jeſus the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new covenant, and therefore <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, and again I ſay rejoyce,</hi> and bleſs his name that hath brought you hither, you are come to God, to Chriſt, to Angels, to Saints, to grace, and ſhall come to glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Improve this precious priviledge to the utmoſt: come to God in the name of Jeſus, <hi>come with boldneſs to the throne of grace, &amp;c.</hi> Let not thy imperfections and unworthineſs keep thee back, remember in all thy approches to God, that Jeſus the mediator is with him for thee: and <hi>be even liveth to make interceſſion</hi> for thee: be encouraged therefore to improve thy intereſt in this Mediator who will never <hi>fail thee nor forſake thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Oh! But, may ſome poor ſouls ſay, I am a ſinner and am affraid, and oft times to look up, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170388:56"/> am much diſcouraged by reaſon of the ſinfull nature and the evil that doth attend me, what may I do in this caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So much the more need man of a Mediator, and ſo much the more need to be looking up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thy intereſt in heaven, and know he is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for thoſe that are ſinners, burthened with ſin, therefore let not that diſcourage thee from looking up to Jeſus, but rather look the more to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I know not oft times how to pray, nor what to pray for as I ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He knows what thy wants are, and will pray for thee, he is thy Mediator, and he gives his ſpirit <hi>to intercede for thee with ſighs and groans, which cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. Therefore go to God in the name of Jeſus, be not diſcouraged, but ſeek there, and what ever you pray for let it be in the name of your Mediator. In truth I do believe that the Lords people have failed much in this matter: and to be much look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in our Mediator, would be the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail much with God. <hi>John</hi> 16. 23. <hi>Whatſoever ye ask the Father in my name he will give it you.</hi> And above all take heed that ye be not enſnared by the adverſary, to turn your back upon this bleſſed Mediator that is in heaven for his people. This (I may ſay) is the laſt and the great ſnare of the devil at this day, to deſtroy faith in this great truth of the Goſpel, and to prevail on poor creatures to turn their back on Chriſt Jeſus the Mediator of the new covenant. Tremble at this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, be it under never ſo glorious a pretence.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, let this be a word to invite and engage poor ſinners to come in to Jeſus, to this Mediator, to this covenant, a high and glorious eſtate. Oh, let not any poor ſouls content themſelves in any eſtate ſhort of this, ſhort of Jeſus the Mediator is nothing but death. Conſider what your ſouls need is, and that he invites all burdened and heavy laden ſinners to come to him. Oh,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170388:57"/> therefore away to Jeſus, there is love, there is life, there is pardon, there is peace, and in a word, the perfection of all good, but ſhort of him, there is nothing but wo and miſery, and death, indignation and wrath, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh, on every ſoul that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
